Thirty-four-year-old boda boda cyclist Geoffrey Kipng’etich is Kenya’s latest millionaire. Kipng’etich won Sh12 million SportPesa jackpot after correctly predicting outcomes of 13 football matches in this week’s jackpot games. The elated businessman, who was introduced to betting two years ago by a neighbour, said winning the jackpot was a dream come true for him. The businessman from Keringet area of Nakuru County said he will use the money to pay school fee for his children and use the rest to buy a parcel of land on which he would build a house. Kipng’etich placed a bet worth Sh300 and won the Sh12,646,353 jackpot. His win comes two weeks after Lessos resident Shadrack Kitur took home Sh22.8 million SportPesa jackpot. Following his good fortune, Kipng’etich, who has never held a bank account, was accompanied by his family as he opened his first bank account in Molo. SportPesa’s new mid-week jackpot for correct prediction of 13 matches has opened at Sh10 million and will keep growing every week until it’s won. A correct prediction of 17 matches will see individuals win a mega jackpot amount that stands at a whooping Sh137,386,214. Just like the jackpot, the mega-jackpot will keep growing until it is won.
