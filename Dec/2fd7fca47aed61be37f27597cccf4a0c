Galole MP Hassan Dukicha on Monday shocked residents when he poured water on Tana River Governor Hussein Dado and County Commissioner Isaiah Nakoru at the Hola Stadium during Jamhuri Day celebrations that the legislator led rowdy youth to disrupt. Mr Dukicha stormed the event and sat next to Mr Dado and Nakoru. Appearing to be irritated by something, he turned on the two and poured water on the two from a bottle he was drinking from. He was accompanied by youth and boda boda riders who were chanting slogans. The youth, donning white T-shirts with the inscriptions ‘G8 Movement’ and ‘I am a member’, arrived at the stadium in pickup trucks and motorcycles led by the MP. Mr Dukicha was apparently irritated after security officers blocked his team from accessing the dais. The youth carried the MP on their shoulders but security officers forced them to put him down and only allowed him and a few aspirants to proceed to the dais. Eyewitnesses said Mr Dukicha was rattled by remarks directed at him by an unspecified opponent seated behind him on the dais before he threw the bottle of water towards the governor and county commissioner. Mr Dado and Mr Nakoru were not moved by the embarrassing incident and only watched as the drama unfolded. Contacted for comment, the county commissioner dismissed Mr Dukicha’s action as an inconsequential incident. Mr Dado was not immediately available for comment but his director of communication Galgallo Fayo confirmed the incident. “Indeed the incident happened but both the governor and the county commissioner were unmoved and they did not want the historical national event to be diluted by such a trivial issue,” Mr Fayo told the Nation on Tuesday.
