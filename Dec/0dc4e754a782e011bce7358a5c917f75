Nominated Senator Paul Njoroge Ben has officially defected from the Jubilee Party to former ruling party Kanu which is led by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. Senator Njoroge, who until his defection was a member of the Jubilee steering committee, cited lack of democracy and transparency as the reason for him returning back to his former party. According to him, the just concluded grassroots elections of interim Jubilee Party officials in Nakuru County were full of massive irregularities. As such, he said the party cannot be trusted to have free and fair nominations. “The election of interim officials was not free and fair as we witnessed direct rigging from officials. I decided to come back to my party where I enjoyed democratic space for a long time,” said the senator. He expressed his confidence that the independence party will once again be a force to reckon with. He was received by Senator Moi, the party chairman, and West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo who warmly welcomed. KANU A SAFE PLACE Senator Moi, who expressed his delight at the defection, said Kanu is a safe place for everyone and termed the defection as a reflection of dissatisfaction in the Jubilee Party. “We are happy to receive back one of our own who had gone wandering elsewhere but decided to come back. This only shows that the members are not happy in the Jubilee Party. He further called upon all members who formerly belonged to the Kanu to return as their place is still reserved. However, Mr Moi maintained that the party will continue strengthening itself ahead of the 2017 general elections in efforts to bargain for power. He said that Kanu will continue working with the Jubilee coalition until their term in office expires in 2017 when the delegates will decide on its fate.
