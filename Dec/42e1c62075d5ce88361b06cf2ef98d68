A teachers union will on Friday converge in Malindi for its annual delegates’ conference who will focus deliberations on declining membership besides implementation of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Kuppet Chairman Omboko Milemba said the two-day conference will be attended by 687 delegates from across the country. “During the exercise, we will also elect three trustees to manage the affairs of the union and its properties,” he said. The meeting comes a week after Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) concluded its annual delegate’s conference in Nairobi whose main focus was the speedy implementation of the CBA. During the just concluded validation exercise, Kuppet lost about 7,000 members. The conference will also provide an opportunity to the union leadership to explain to its members the CBA which has been criticised by some teachers with the union leadership admitting that it has some gaps such as promotion and the methodology for the same. Other contentious issues include academic progress and how it will be rewarded, house allowances, actualisation of the CBA and time frame as well as hardship allowances among others. The unions have also been facing cash crisis after the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) decided to suspend collection of dues for months and which has since been reinstated. Some of the staff of the unions went months without salaries due to the standoff. Also to be discussed is curriculum review, and which the union insists must be done with the involvement of teachers as the key implementers.
