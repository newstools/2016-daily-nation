Gor Mahia’s youth coach Maurice Onyango has backed his charges to go one better and win the Kenyan Premier League Under 20 football tournament this month. The 11-day youth competition begins this morning at the Camp Toyoyo grounds in Nairobi. Onyango’s charges will play Posta Rangers in one of the four fixtures lined up. Having dramatically lost to Mathare United in the final of the last edition of this competition in August, the Dutch-trained coach told Saturday Nation Sport on Saturday, that he has tied up a few loose ends, which he believes cost his team the title. “It was painful to concede in the last minute. My boys were very disappointed,” said the Onyango. The former Ligi Ndogo Academy and Zetech College coach added: “I want to ensure my boys maintain high concentration levels. If we can manage that, then we stand a good chance of winning the competition”. Onyango said he would parade his new signings, Barding High School attacker Oscar Omondi, and Richard Okinyi who’s been recruited from Kakamega High School. He urged the tournament’s administrators to reign in on age cheats. In the other games on Saturday, defending champions Mathare United will host Muhoroni Youth, Chemelil Sugar face Sony Sugar while Western Stima will battle it out against Ulinzi Stars. At the same time, Kakamega Homeboyz coach Gilbert Selebwa and his AFC Leopards counterpart Boniface Ambani are also confident of winning the title.
