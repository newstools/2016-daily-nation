Public hospitals in Nakuru, Nyandarua, Narok, Samburu and Laikipia counties remained deserted on Monday as health workers  kept off work. Patients seeking treatment at the health facilities continued suffering as they were turned away by security guards, with nobody in sight to attend to them. The most affected were those scheduled for Caesarean sections, surgeries and expectant mothers who had to seek immediate help elsewhere in private facilities. At the Nakuru Level Five Hospital, which serves as a referral centre for Nyandarua, Narok, Samburu, Laikipia, Baringo and Kericho counties, the families of patients had to transfer them to private hospitals. Ms Waithera Kamau’s son, who has arthritis, writhed in pain after he missed a crucial monthly injection. FEW WORKERS REPORTED ON DUTY “I am confused because l cannot get the injection elsewhere. I fear for my son’s life,” she told the Daily Nation, breaking down. At the Nyahururu County Referral and Rumuruti Sub-County hospitals in Laikipia County, only a handful of health workers reported for duty on Monday. In Samburu County, nurses took to the streets of Maralal Town, carrying placards as they chanted slogans urging the county government to address their plight. Most families transferred their patients to Wamba Mission hospital, 106km from Maralal. Meanwhile, the Nakuru County Government has started receiving applications for job vacancies to fill positions of 1,200 striking nurses after attempts to resolve a stalemate over delayed and unfair promotions hit a snag.
