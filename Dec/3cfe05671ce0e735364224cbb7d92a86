Today’s column, ladies, gentlemen and daughters of Zayuni, will be more reflective and poignant than the usual brash and rude City Girl you all hate to love. (I know the phrase is “love to hate”, but I am an optimist). I thought I could I share a lesson or two that I learnt in 2016, the year that many lives changed. You need enemies: Take it from a girl who knows a thing or two about having enemies. You cannot please everyone. That is fine. Not everyone will give you a standing ovation. That is okay. You need enemies. If you don’t have enemies, please make some. Here’s why; enemies are a sign of progress. Enemies are just closeted fans who feel a little threatened by how far you have come. Nobody ever hated on a person they did not secretly admire. After all, even the good book says “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies”. (Psalm 23:5). If you don’t have enemies, before whom do you think the good Lord shall prepare a banquet for you? Even God has budgeted for your enemies, so quit that naïve thinking that everyone ought to be your friend.
