Nurses will continue being on strike even as they prepare to attend a final negotiation meeting at the Ministry of Health on Friday. The talks, they said, will determine whether or not the strike will be called off. Despite being holed up in a day-long meeting with Ministry of Health officials, the officials walked out of Afya House a few minutes to 7pm on Thursday without reaching an agreement. The talks were led by the Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) officials a day after talks between doctors and the government collapsed. Knun’s deputy Secretary General Maurice Opetu told the nurses that no agreement had been reached. “After tomorrow (Friday), we will know if the strike will be off. For now we will not reveal a lot,” he said. Nurses and Clinical officers joined doctors in a nationwide strike that started on Monday. They are demanding that the Council of Governors sign the recognition of Agreement drafted and signed by the ministry in 2013. “We are not asking for a raise. All we want is harmonisation of our pay cheques,” said Eunice Ngare who heads Knun Nairobi branch. The nurses said they were tired of being taken round by the ministry even as the strike enters its fifth day on Friday. Doctors, dentists, pharmacists and nurses have skipped work since Monday following the lapse of a 21-day notice despite the existence of an order from the Employment and Labour Relations Court stopping the strike from being held. On Wednesday, the same court said that doctors and nurses’ union officials risk jail for acting in contempt of the order. Lady Justice Hellen Wasilwa directed the Kilimani police chief to assist in having the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union and Knun officials to be presented in court to explain why they should not be committed to civil jail.
