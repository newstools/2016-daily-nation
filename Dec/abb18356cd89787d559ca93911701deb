AFC Leopards is restructuring the team ahead of the 2017 season. According to the club’s secretary general, Oscar Igaida, Ingwe have released a total of 12 players to pave the way for new recruits. “We are intending to recruit seven new players in all departments. The coach (Stewart Hall) has given us a list of the players he wants in the team to ensure that we are a force to reckon with come next year,” said Igaida. Leopards, who broke their training camp on Friday to resume on January 3rd, have released Jackson Saleh back to Gor Mahia. The central defender re-joined the den in June on a six-month loan but has been recalled by K’Ogalo. The club is set to renew the contract of Lucas Indeche, which ends on December 31st, while Moussa Sissoko has returned to his Malian club Djoliba FC. Ingwe have mutually agreed with Edwin Wafula, who is reported to be heading to the newly promoted Nzoia United while midfielder Benard Ongoma has joined Ulinzi Stars, who have offered him a military course. Seven other players Kepha Aswani, Charles Bruno, Simon Abuko, Eugen Ambulwa, Yusuf Juma, John Ndirangu and Yusuf Suf will be loaned to other clubs. Ingwe are trailing Western Stima goalkeeper Gabriel Andika and Dennis Sikhayi. The former Nakuru AllStars full back right still has a year left on his contract at Stima.
