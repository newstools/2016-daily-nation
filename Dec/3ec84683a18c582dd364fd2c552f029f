Six family members from Msinga in Voi, Taita Taveta County are nursing injuries after they were swept away by floods following a heavy downpour. The six, including a one-year-old boy, were swept away after their house was washed away by flash floods on Sunday night. Speaking to the Nation on Monday, Evangeline Mwakulila, said her family lost everything and they are now being housed by good Samaritans. “My six children and I sustained injuries but we are yet to get treatment because all our money was swept away by the water,” she said. She said they could not afford to seek treatment in private hospitals which are too expensive for them. She said the best alternative would have been public hospitals but they cannot get treatment from their either as doctors and nurses are on strike. “A good Samaritan has offered me Sh500 which I will use to take one of my children to hospital because she is very ill,” she said. At the same time, more than thirty families in Voi Sub-County were Sunday night forced to sleep in the cold after their houses were washed away by floods after heavy rains. The families from Sofia, Tanzania and Maungu are in need of food, shelter and clean drinking water after their household properties were destroyed by the floods. Taita Taveta Kenya Red Cross coordinator, Mr James Ngunzi, said a team is in Maungu to assess the situation. Mr Ngunzi said they will help the victims with basic necessities. “We will see how we can help them. First we have to assess the situation and by tomorrow (Tuesday) we will give them our support,” said Mr Ngunzi. Maungu residents blamed the builders of the standard gauge railway saying they diverted the water to their homes during the construction. "Before we never used to experience floods. They should have dug trenches to [contain] rain water," a resident, Mr Stanley Mwamburi, said.
