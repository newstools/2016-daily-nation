Nurses in Nyeri have been directed to report to work Tuesday amid disagreements in their union over a deal signed with the government to end a weeklong strike. Nyeri county commissioner, Oningoi ole Sossio and Deputy Governor Samuel Wamaathai speaking during Jamhuri Day celebrations in Nyeri town said that nurses were expected to resume duty as the strike had been called off. The County commissioner was firm when he told the nurses to return to work as he warned them against being incited to stay away from hospitals. “The strike was called off so we expect nurses to report to work tomorrow. We know there are some people trying to incite you to stay home but you must resume duty,” said Mr Oningoi. Deputy Governor, Mr Wamaathai assured nurses that their grievances would be looked into adequately hence they should resume their duties and provide health services. “As the county government we are ready to work together with nurses to ensure there is a harmonious and fair working environment,” said the Deputy Governor. This comes as uncertainty engulfs the Kenya National Union of Nurses after Secretary General, Seth Panyako dismissed a decision by three officials of the union to call off the strike. Mr Panyako accused Chairman John Bii, Deputy Secretary Maurice Opetu and the assistant Chief Trustee Alice Oreng of being compromised into ending the strike before a proper agreement was made. He denounced the agreement signed by the three officials and the ministry of health saying they are not mandated to sign any agreements for the union. Health services in public hospitals have been paralysed for the last one week across the country as the health workers demanded a review into their salaries.
