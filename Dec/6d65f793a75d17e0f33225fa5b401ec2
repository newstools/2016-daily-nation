Three passengers died Friday morning after a bus overturned at the Bonje black spot in Mazeras on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. The driver of the TSS company bus lost control and the vehicle plunged into a trench on the side of the road. The bus was travelling from Nairobi to Mombasa when the accident happened. A National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) official, who could not be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said more than 25 people were injured in the crash. Three other passengers were still trapped in the bus. The NTSA official said the rescue mission was being hampered by lack of equipment such as gas metal cutters. The injured passengers were taken to Coast Provincial General Hospital, with one in a critical condition being transferred to a private hospital.
