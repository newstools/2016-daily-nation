Three people died on the spot on Friday morning after the vehicle they were travelling in was involved in a crash on the Bomet-Sotik road. The crash between a bus belonging to Easy Coach Company and a 14-seater matatu happened at around 5am in Kapkures, Bomet County. The bus was heading to Migori while the matatu was taking passengers to Maasai Mara University in Narok to attend a graduation ceremony held on Friday. All the dead were aboard the matatu while 13 others were admitted to Sotik Sub-County Hospital in Bomet, according to Bomet County Police Commander Leah Kithei. ESCAPED UNHURT “All the passengers aboard the bus escaped unhurt,” said Ms Kithei. She said the driver of the ill-fated matatu lost control and rammed the oncoming bus. The bodies of the deceased were taken to the Kapkatet Hospital mortuary in neighbouring Kericho County. “I am appealing to drivers to exercise care while plying the various routes, especially during this Christmas festive period, when their passengers are heading to various destinations,” Ms Kithei said.
