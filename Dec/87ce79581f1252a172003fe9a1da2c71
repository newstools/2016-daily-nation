A man was on Saturday found dead inside his car in Umoja, Nairobi County. He is said to have been a Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) soldier. Witnesses said the man had been drinking with two women at a bar in Umoja. Police say the women might have drugged the man before going to his house, where they stole goods. Police are yet to remove the body from the scene. Personnel from KDF arrived at the scene Saturday afternoon. The soldier is said to have returned from Somalia last month.
