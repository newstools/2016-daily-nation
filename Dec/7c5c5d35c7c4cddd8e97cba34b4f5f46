Candidates for seats in Parliament will now be required to have at least a degree, while those wishing to be members of county assemblies (MCAs) must have a post-secondary school diploma. This follows last night’s vote by MPs on a bill by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to amend various election-related laws. After the 2022 elections, MCAs will also be required to have a degree. The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill is, however, still some way from full approval as MPs have to pass one final vote on the proposed law in its entirety and hand it over to the Senate. The clause was passed without debate. With lawmakers starting their December break last night — though they are likely to return for special sittings to consider nominees to the electoral commission and the revenue allocation commission, and the Budget Policy Statement — the Bill will take some time before it gets to President Kenyatta for approval. This would give time to MPs and aspirants opposed to the proposal to lobby for its scrapping either by the Senate or by the President via a veto when it is presented to him for his signature.
