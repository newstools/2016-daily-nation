PARIS Cristiano Ronaldo and Antoine Griezmann both appeared among the 55 nominees for the FIFPro 2016 World 11 released on Thursday but Wayne Rooney failed to make the shortlist for the first time. Portugal captain Ronaldo, led his country to victory at Euro 2016, while France forward Griezmann was the top player at the tournament. It is the first time that 25-year-old Griezmann has made the cut, but England captain Rooney is absent for the first time in the competition's 12-year history, after England crashed out of Euro 2016 to lowly Iceland. That leaves Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo as the only ever-presents for an award based on votes from professional players from 75 countries. Also absent from the list is Algerian international Riyad Mahrez, the top Premier League player last season with surprise champions Leicester. The eight newcomers also include France's N'Golo Kant√© and Dimitri Payet, Ivorian Serge Aurier, Spaniard Hector Bellerin, Italian Leonardo Bonucci, Belgian Kevin De Bruyne, Argentina's Paulo Dybala and England's Jamie Vardy. Barcelona lead the way with 12 players, two more than rivals Real Madrid, whose selected players include Welsh winger Gareth Bale. Other big names overlooked are Manchester City pair Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure, Chelsea's John Terry, Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben, Porto's Iker Casillas and Real Madrid's James Rodriguez.
