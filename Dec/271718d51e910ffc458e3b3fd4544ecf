Governor Evans Kidero has said Nairobi County has set aside Sh200 million to fund renovation works at City Stadium. Speaking on Sunday in Nairobi during the launch of this year’s edition of Governors Cup, Kidero said half of the amount of money to be spent in renovating City Stadium has already been budgeted for by the Sports Ministry. “The pitch and the tartan track will be removed and replaced with a modern stadium. The terraces will also be refurbished, we will also have new toilets because the existing ones are not in good condition,” Kidero said at City Stadium on Sunday. Renovation works are expected to start in a month’s time, and the 15,000-seater facility, which was barred from hosting Kenyan Premier matches this year owing to its deplorable state, will be ready for use in August, according to Kidero. Meanwhile, Mbotela Kamaliza spanked rivals Mbotela All Stars 4-1 in the opening game of the Governors Cup. SH1.5M PRIZE MONEY After a scoreless first half, the well attended derby sprung into life in the second stanza, with goals from Wesley Jerome, Abraham Kisebu and a Samson Odhiambo double securing the result for the triumphant team. In between the goals, Conrad Omondi scored the consolation for All Stars. The seven month-long football competition, which will bring together 17,000 players drawn from 700 teams, will see the winning team take home Sh1.5 million in prize money. The second and third-placed teams will pocket Sh1 million and 500,000 respectively, whilst the standout goalkeeper, best player and top scorer will each be awarded Sh250,000. The event, sponsored by Nairobi County Liqour and Licensing Board, aims at sensitising members of the public against the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption.
