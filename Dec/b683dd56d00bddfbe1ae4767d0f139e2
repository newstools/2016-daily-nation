Some 24,795 Standard Eight candidates have been selected to join 103 national schools. This is an increase of 1,710 from 2015, when 23,085 pupils secured slots in the top schools. In selection results announced Tuesday by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i, another 133,785 candidates will join county schools as 65,331 head to extra-county learning centres. Some 492,576 Standard Eight leavers have also been chosen to be students in sub-county schools. Dr Matiang'i said the transition rate from primary to secondary school had increased to 84 per cent, up from 82 per cent last year. LETTERS ONLINE The selection, done at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development in Nairobi, was based on merit, quotas, equity, affirmative action and candidates' choices. Dr Matiang’i said admission letters would be posted on the Education ministry website, www.education.go.ke. However, parents can check the schools their children have been selected to join by sending an SMS with the candidate’s index number to 20042 from any network.
