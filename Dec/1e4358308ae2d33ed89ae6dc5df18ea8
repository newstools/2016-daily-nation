The names of students selected to join Form One in the 103 national schools will be announced on Monday. A total of 942,021 learners are eyeing more than 780,000 secondary school slots. Those chosen to join extra-county and county schools will know their fate before the end of the week. Focus will also be on whether the transition goes beyond last year’s 82 per cent in which 759,603 out of 925,744 joined secondary schools. The selection has been going on for the last one week in Naivasha after the release of the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examination results on December 1. Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i will preside over the event at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development offices in Nairobi.Candidates selected will be expected to report to school on January 9. Education officials have remained tight-lipped on how candidates will join secondary schools, given the low performance in the examination.Last year, 23,085 students joined national schools, which was an increase from 20,291 in 2014. Dr Matiang’i said all the 5,143 candidates who scored above 400 marks this year will join national schools irrespective of their gender, region or centre. “The performance of the candidates in this year’s examination was slightly lower than that of 2015,” he said. DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS Candidates would be admitted to public secondary schools based on merit, quotas, equity, affirmative action and candidates’ choices. “The selection will also ensure that children from disadvantaged backgrounds continue with their education,” said the minister. Kenya Private Schools Association chief executive officer Peter Ndoro said the organisation expects the selection to go on well, with no child being discriminated against. Kenya Secondary School Heads Association chairman Kahi Indimuli said secondary schools were ready to receive the students next year. “We will know the candidates each school has been allocated. After this, we can plan effectively for them,” said Mr Indimuli. Most of the 226,000 candidates who scored below 200 marks may not join secondary schools next year. On average, these candidates — about 24 per cent — obtained 35 per cent in each of the five subjects they were tested in. Out of the 226,000, some 6,747 had less than 100 marks out of the possible 500, which means they obtained an average of 25 per cent in each paper.The pass mark is 250 out of the possible 500.This year, 207,141 candidates scored between 301 and 400 marks, and 501,552 obtained 201 to 300 marks.Most of them may end up in youth polytechnics.Elimu Yetu Coalition coordinator Janet Muthoni said the ministry should give all the candidates an opportunity to pursue secondary education as required by the Basic Education Act.   Matiang’i will release the names of candidates who will join 103 national schools.
