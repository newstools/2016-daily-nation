Ugandan defender Martin Kizza is the 2016 Tusker FC Player of the Year. Kizza, who re-joined the club at the beginning of the season after a year at AFC Leopards, beat favourites Humphrey Mieno, Osborne Monday and goalkeeper David Okello to the award. "I want to thank the club for this award. It wasn't easy but I'm very happy," said Kizza amid a round of applause from the guests at the club Gala held at Barclays Sports Club on Thursday night. Earlier, Mieno had won the Midfielder of the Year award, while Okello walked away with the Goalkeeping gong. Monday was named the club's finest in October when the club inched closer to the Kenyan Premier League title and also won the GOtv Shield title. Kenyan international striker Allan Wanga emerged the club's top scorer. Luis Misiko was also named the club's Most Promising Player. Hashim Sempala, the defensive midfielder signed from Bul FC from Uganda in June, was awarded the club's Player of the Month for November â€” the month the club won the league title in Nakuru. Veteran Ghanian striker Stephen Owusu won the club's Goal of the Season award as Lloyd Wahome claimed the Defender of the Year gong. But it was Kizza's award that came as a surprise. The Ugandan was the biggest winner of the night at the gala.
