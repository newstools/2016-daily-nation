The African Union and the international community should take a keen interest in the political developments that have rocked the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the recent past. The killing of civilians as tensions rise over President Joseph Kabilaâ€™s prolonged stay in power is a blot on the conscience Africa. African leaders should not wait for the situation in Congo to go out of control. The time to act is now. The people of DRC deserve the opportunity to elect their leaders and get their voice heard through the ballot. Therefore, the world should bring pressure to bear on the leadership of that country to find a quick, just, and amicable solution to the impasse, including bringing all the rival parties to the negotiating table and getting them to agree on an election timetable. The violence in the DRC should serve as a warning that African leaders must hold themselves to the highest standards of accountability and fidelity to the rule of law for the benefit of their people and to ensure peace, stability, and progress. The leadership in that country should borrow a leaf from other African countries that have held elections that have led to peaceful transitions. There is no reason why the international community should not hold the DRC to the same standards.
