Edith is a media personality, journalist and CNN Fellow, currently working as a DW News correspondent.  1. What is your definition of feminism? Equalising opportunity spaces between men and women across the board.  2. What do you think is your next frontier, career-wise? What, in your field, have you always secretly wanted to do? Having a show by Africans about Africans. There’s always a part of me that feels we don’t know enough about each other. Ourselves. Oh, and being a news anchor with an international broadcaster.  3. Which book did you read last? Plato’s, The Symposium. A friend spotted it when I was book browsing (my favourite thing to do ever) in the used copies section. As for the book, what a dinner!  4. What is the most annoying part of being on television? Being on television. It can get in the way of genuine connections. When people think they know you, the truth is that they never get to. What’s worse, they often show you what they think you want to see. It can feel like a cycle of superficial chats.  5. In what way do you think the next elections are going to shape Kenya? Difficult to say how; but if I had to deductively reason it out, I’d say given the trend in the West, we might hear some populist ideas coming up. A heavily youth-driven campaign with youth-driven issues. Then again, I’m just deducing.
