Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary-general Wilson Sossion has come under fire from parents of an international chain of schools over remarks he made about the learning centres. The parents and teachers of Bridge International Academies also want to meet Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i over the quality of education offered at the schools. They said on Thursday that administrators had started the process of registering all of its 405 academies across the country in line with the new government regulations. The parents and teachers faulted Mr Sossion over his recent remarks about the quality of education offered at the schools. They said Mr Sossion's statement had psychologically harmed pupils and teachers at the schools. “We are offering alternative basic education and training. In the eight years we have been operational in Kenya, we have been able to demonstrate that even on [a] very limited budget we can deliver,” said Celestine Tabu, a member of the parents and teachers committee. They now want Mr Sossion to withdraw his remarks, which suggested that the schools face closure. Ms Tabu hailed Dr Matiang’i for handling the matter rationally and asked him to meet with Bridge stakeholders so as to find an amicable solution. Hadija Abduba, the chairwoman of the committee who also present, rubbished Mr Sosion's claims that teachers hired to work at the academies were untrained. She said the teachers are P1 trained professionals and are registered by the Teachers Service Commission.
