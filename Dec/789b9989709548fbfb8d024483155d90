The house of 2013 Deputy President candidate Winnie Kaburu has been vandalised in a property ownership row in Westlands, Nairobi. Mrs Kaburu told the Nation that a gang of over 50 men, armed with guns and other crude weapons, stormed into her house on Friday evening and started destroying property. The attackers broke her watchmanâ€™s foot and injured her daughter who is now admitted to MP Shah Hospital, Nairobi. Mrs Kaburu claims she bought the property located on Raphta Road, off Pilipili Drive. SH14 MILLION She said she paid Sh14 million to a Mr Chanda but had not effected transfer of the property. Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko was among county leaders who visited the home on Saturday morning to face land-grabbing-and-property-vandalism madness that has gripped the city county. Land cartels have been grabbing properties in Nairobi with impunity, a move that has forced the Cabinet to freeze renewal of land leases. The grabbers have been evicting families and flattening properties in broad daylight, sometimes with the help and armed protection of police.  More to follow.   Cartels targeting people of Asian descent and grabbing their land.
