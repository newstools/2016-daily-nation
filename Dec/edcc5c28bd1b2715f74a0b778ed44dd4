The property of an ODM youth leader in Homa Bay County was burnt on Saturday morning by unknown people. An eyewitness said a gang torched Kevin Ouma's shop in Homa Bay town, with five adjacent structures near the town's post office also going up in flames in the 4am fire. Homa OCPD Esau Ochorokodi said police were investigating the blaze. “We are investigating this matter to ascertain if the torching of the properties belonging to the ODM politician is political or not,” Mr Ochorokodi said. One of the victims of the fire said he lost goods worth Sh500,000. Some of the shops sold beauty products.
