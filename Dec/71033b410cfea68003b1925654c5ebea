Residents in Kisumu blocked a major highway to protest against pollution of a local river. The protesters in Nyamasaria in Kisumu East Sub-County blocked the Kisumu-Nairobi highway, causing traffic snarl-up. They said Kibos Sugar Company is emitting effluent into River Nyamasaria, claims that company director Raju Sign has denied. "The whole of December we have not been operational because of maintenance and it is wrong for somebody to accuse us of emitting raw effluent into the river," Mr Sign said. Kisumu East politician John Anditi said residents rely on water from the river and the firm should not contaminate it. "Our people entirely rely on this river for domestic purposes and it is unfortunate it has been heavily polluted by raw effluent," he said. Mr Anditi called on the Health Ministry and other relevant authorities to investigate the pollution. Eunice Owino, a resident, said it is wrong for the local leadership to allow the company and a local hotel to release raw effluent into the river. â€œWomen and children who rely on the river have fallen ill due to poor hygiene caused by the raw effluent discharged into the river...," Ms Owino said. Kisumu East Deputy County Commissioner Josephine Ouko and her deputy Lilian Itibo went to the scene and urged residents to be calm as the matter is invesitigated.
