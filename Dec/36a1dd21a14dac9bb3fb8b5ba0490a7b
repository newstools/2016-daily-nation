The assertion by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission that the Ministry of Health is the most corrupt among both national and county government agencies should serve as a wake-up call to top officials to take action against those diverting public resources for private gain. The President and the governors must send a strong message that their governments will not tolerate theft of public resources by sending home the officers found culpable and challenging investigative agencies to charge the culprits in court. The public is unhappy with the government’s inability to end the ongoing doctors’ strike, which has paralysed public hospitals and left many Kenyans, many of whom cannot afford the high charges in private institutions, in agony. With Kenyans travelling to be with their loved ones at this time of the year, many are vulnerable because they will have nowhere to go if they fall ill, are involved in an accident, or need the services of a doctor for any other reason. This is unacceptable. Order and sanity must be brought back to the health sector. The current situation must not be allowed to persist. Left unchecked, this steady decline is likely to spread its cancer to other government institutions, with disastrous results.
