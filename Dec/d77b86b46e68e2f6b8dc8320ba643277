Deputy President William Ruto, who was expected to graduate on Friday from the University of Nairobi with a doctorate, will now have to wait until next year. Mr Ruto's name is missing from the graduation list, despite his announcement in June this year that he would graduate with a doctor of philosophy (PhD) in plant ecology in December. However, Kimuyu Maingi and Njeru Mugambi, who, like Mr Ruto, also studied plant ecology, will graduate with doctorates from the School of Biological Sciences. A total of 53 students will receive PhDs during the graduation ceremony. Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka will graduate with a master's degree in law. Mr Ruto’s doctoral thesis centres on the impact of human activity on riparian reserves at Saiwa Swamp in Trans Nzoia County. “I’ve finished the data collection and analysis. Now I’m on the write-up,” the deputy president told the Nation in June. On Friday, 474 students will receive diplomas, 4,946 will get bachelor's degrees and 2,316 will collect master's degrees. President Uhuru Kenyatta will receive an honorary PhD from the university. On Thursday, Mr Ruto tweeted: “As a PhD student, I have subjected myself to that standard. I was due to graduate tomorrow, but I can’t because of requirements.” “I urge all colleges to observe set standards and award certificates to students purely on merit,” he said on his Twitter page.
