This Christmas, why not try something different from the traditional chicken or turkey? Fish can take the place of poultry and hold its own in a most delectable fashion. The secret to giving it a  unique taste lies in how well you can balance the herbs and spices in this recipe. Try this quick, easy to prepare dish as part of your Christmas fare. Ingredients: Serves 4 Cooking and preparation time: 45 minutes 1 tbsp vegetable oil 4 tilapia fillets, skinned and boned 1 tsp mixed herbs ½- tbsp lemon juice and zest 1 pinch black pepper 1 knob unsalted butter 1 tbsp all purpose flour Salt to taste. Method: 1. In a frying pan, add the vegetable oil and heat over medium heat. Add the tilapia fillets and fry each side slowly for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. 2. In a bowl, combine the mixed herbs, lemon juice and zest and black pepper. In a saucepan, melt the butter.  Add the flour and mix well for one minute before adding the herb mixture. Allow to cook for two minutes. Add a little water and salt to taste. If you require a thicker sauce, add more flour and stir well to prevent lumping. 3. Pour the sauce over the fried fish fillets and serve on a bed of creamed potatoes, accompanied by lightly steamed vegetables. Cooking Tips: • Do not overcook the fish as this will cause it to crumble. • Always use a non-stick pan to sauté fish for even cooking. • Ensure that the oil is hot before placing fish into the pan. This will seal the fish and leave it non-oily.
