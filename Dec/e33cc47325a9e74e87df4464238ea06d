DNA tests will be conducted on all bodies of victims of Naivasha tragedy. The National Disaster Centre Director Nathan Kigotho said 36 bodies were transferred to Chiromo mortuary while four others are at Kenyatta University mortuary. He said the bodies will be released to relatives for burial after two weeks, when results of the DNA tests will be released. He said identification of bodies will start Monday afternoon but added that those identified will also be subjected to DNA tests. Mr Kigotho said the tests would help prevent release of wrong bodies to relatives for burial.
