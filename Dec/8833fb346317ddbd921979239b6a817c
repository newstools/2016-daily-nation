LONDON Southampton dealt Arsenal a shock defeat in the English League Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday as goals from Jordy Clasie and Ryan Bertrand earned Claude Puel's side a 2-0 win. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had been hoping to win the competition for the first time, but instead his decision to make 10 changes backfired as Southampton ended his side's 19-game unbeaten run. Southampton, who also eliminated Arsenal from the competition two seasons ago, reached the semi-finals after losing their last six last-eight ties in the competition. Puel's side join Liverpool, Hull City and either Manchester United or West Ham United — who were facing off in Wednesday's other quarter-final — in the draw for the last four. Dutch midfielder Clasie's blistering drive put Southampton ahead in the 13th minute at the Emirates Stadium. England left-back Bertrand added a second seven minutes before half-time, gathering Sofiane Boufal's pass and rifling a shot into the bottom corner. Mohamed Elneny was the only player to have kept his place from Arsenal's 3-1 win over Bournemouth on Sunday, but he succumbed to injury before half-time and was replaced by Granit Xhaka. It was Arsenal's first defeat since a 4-3 loss at home to Liverpool on the opening weekend of the Premier League season.
