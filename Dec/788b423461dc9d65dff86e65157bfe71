Some 50 local coaches are set to benefit from a week-long coaching course conducted by trainers attached to English Premier League giants Arsenal. The training programme started on Monday at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies in Nairobi, with the trainers focussing on impacting local coaches with talent identification skills as the country seeks to qualify for 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. The Arsenal coaching team of James Colinese, Jonny Georgious and Drew Tyler, which is in the country courtesy of sports betting firm SportPesa, will be joined on Thursday by former Arsenal defender Lauren Bisan Etamé-Mayer who was a key member of Arsenal’s Invincibles team that won the English Premier League with 49 games unbeaten in the 2003/2004 season. Lauren played right-back and made 241 appearance for Arsenal between 2000 and 2007.
