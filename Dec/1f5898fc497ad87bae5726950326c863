The White House on Friday hailed long time Gambian President Yahya Jammeh's decision to concede defeat to a stunning election win by opposition candidate Adama Barrow. "The United States congratulates the people of The Gambia on a peaceful and democratic presidential election that has the potential to mark a new beginning for all Gambians," National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. "We welcome President Yahya Jammeh's concession to President-elect Barrow and welcome President Jammeh's respect for the will of the Gambian people."
