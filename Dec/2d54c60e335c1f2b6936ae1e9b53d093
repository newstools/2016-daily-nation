The flower industry has been thrown into mourning following the death of its pioneer, Johannes Ewaldus Maria Zwager. Known to many as Hans Zwager, the founder of Oserian Development Company Ltd, a leading flower exporter, he died aged 90 last week. Zwager was born in the Netherlands in 1926, and arrived in the country in early 1950s, setting up ABN Bank and later meeting his wife June Patricia Ashworth. One time when he was involved in importation of agricultural spare parts and chemicals, he realised the great potential of agriculture, necessitating his setting up of Kleenway Chemicals in Nairobi and Antipest Ltd in Mombasa in the 1960s. Sometime in 1969, Zwager purchased Oserian Farm in Naivasha, then a mere cattle ranch with 16 employees, with his enterprising appetite seeing him turn it into a premier flower farm that exports the produce to European Union and Dutch markets. The company has developed into a thriving community complete with employees’ housing units, educational and health facilities, among others.     NUMEROUS AWARDSZwager is credited for setting up Tele Flower Auction in Netherlands, the first ever electronic flower market in the world, designed to promote and support Kenyan flower exporters. He further went on to establish World Flowers in 1989, allowing Kenyan horticultural farmers to trade directly with the European superstores. His dedication in the industry didn’t go unnoticed, though. In 1998, former President, Daniel arap Moi presented him with the Moran of the Burning Spear in recognition of his role in directly developing horticulture in the country. He was also presented with The Order of Orange-Nassau by His Royal Highness King William Alexander of the Netherlands for his services to society.   Sitting on 200,000 acres is the 47 year old farm that currently employs 4,100 people.
