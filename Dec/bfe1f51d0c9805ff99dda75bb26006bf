Universities serve as centres of excellence in both academics and sports. European and American institutions of higher learning are known to offer talented athletes sports scholarships to enable them to pursue their academic and sports goals concurrently. Sadly, such programmes are few and far between in Kenyan universities. With the exception of Strathmore University, which offers financial assistance to talented and bright students, local universities have yet to put in place programmes to benefit the youth. Strathmore has benefited from its sports scholarship programmes. This year, the university’s hockey team, which is mostly composed of the beneficiaries of the programme, won the Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League title for the third time. Strathmore’s rugby team has also posted impressive results in the Kenya Cup league, while the institution’s basketball team is giving its opponents a run for their money in the Premier League. Most public universities in Kenya either have inadequate funding for sports activities or have no sports facilities. This is evident at the ongoing East Africa University Games where, with the exception of Strathmore University, Kenyan teams are struggling to post meaningful results. This trend can be reversed through sports scholarships. It is encouraging that the IAAF has chosen Kenyatta University to host the athletes village for next year’s World Under-18 Championships, making it a high performance centre.
