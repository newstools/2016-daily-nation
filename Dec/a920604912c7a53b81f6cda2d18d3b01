In yet another attack, suspected Al-Shabaab terrorists damage Safaricom and Orange telecommunication masts in Kotulo, Mandera County, on Monday night. Elwak Deputy County Commissioner Peter Karanja on Tuesday confirmed the incident and said the masts were destroyed at Chuma Mrefu. Speaking to Nation.co.ke by phone, Mr Karanja said a team of security personnel had been deployed to “find out what exactly happened.” LOUD EXPLOSION Resident Abdi Siadi said: “There was a loud explosion at around 11 pm.” On Monday, gunmen damaged a Safaricom mast at Dabacity, some three kilometres from Kotulo. County Commissioner Fredrick Shisia said the attack happened at about 1.45am. Locals now fear Al-Shabaab militants could be preparing for a major attack following the damage to the equipment. KPR OVERPOWERED During the Dabacity attack, Mr Shisia said the attackers overpowered the five Kenya Police Reservists (KPR) deployed to guard the mast. “The five KPRs guarding the installation tried to resist but the weapons of the attackers were superior, forcing them to run to safety,” he said. He said the KPRs' intervention limited the damage caused by the attackers.   The attackers overpowered police reservists who were guarding the mast.
