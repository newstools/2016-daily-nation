The planned unveiling of a spokesman for the Luhya community is under way at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega County. A bullfighting contest is currently in progress. Tight security is in place, with police officers frisking those entering the venue. Cotu boss Francis Atwoli, Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi and other leaders have arrived at the stadium. A spectator was injured in a stampede after fighting bulls charged at the crowd in the stadium. He was taken to hospital by police. The initiative by Mr Atwoli, a trade unionist, has elicited mixed reactions and sparked intense speculation among leaders in western Kenya, which is considered a key swing-vote region. An endorsement as spokesman is likely to be a major boost to either Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula or Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Mr Atwoli said he had sent invitations to governors, senators and MPs who were supporting his initiative.
