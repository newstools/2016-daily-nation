After a metronomic sequence of exalting runs, As Paragon earned a legitimate niche appropriated for the January 29 Kenya Guineas, by a glittering fringe of 7.5 lengths from Silverado. As Paragon pretty much cantered down the back stretch before letting rip in the H. V. Pirie Christmas Trial Trophy, leaving no precincts for error. Eighth Wonder was withdrawn with reluctance to start, upsetting As Paragon for a good ten minutes. Steve Njuguna, Patrick Mungai, Charles Kimani, Joe Karari, and, Captain Oruya all convened the meeting with flair. Well done to Stewart McCann's popular return on Manzhouli in the Yuletide Duke of Manchester Cup. Julie also swept clear on Hatton Gardens over a Cheer Up Mile. Family toasting.
