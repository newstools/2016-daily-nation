A casual labourer accused of invading a police station in Mumias, Kakamega County and stealing seven guns and 184 rounds of ammunition has been remanded for five days at the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU). Mr Mohammed Were Chiteri who was arrested in Makupa, Mombasa County will remain at the ATPU offices until December 13. Mr Chiteri appeared in Nairobi Milimani law courts before senior resident magistrate Hellen Onkwani late afternoon on Wednesday. State prosecutor Lindsy Mugambi applied to have the suspect detained for five days to establish any links between him and terrorist groups. Booker Police Post in Mumias was raided on November 23 and firearm sstolen. She added that police recovered the guns after an intense search in the area. During the search one person was left dead and scores of others nursing wounds. The operation caused hue and cry from leaders and members of the public. Mr Chiteri did not oppose the request to have him detained for questioning and recording of statement. The investigating officer Corporal Joseph Mwiti said Mr Chiteri fled Mumias immediately the police station was raided. “Mr Chiteri could not state what he was doing at Mombasa,” Mwiti says in a sworn affidavit filed in court. Granting the application by Ms Mugambi, the magistrate said: “The invasion of the police station raised serious questions on the security status in Kakamega County and also in other areas of the country.”   Ipoa has urged the public to give them information on police actions during the operation.
