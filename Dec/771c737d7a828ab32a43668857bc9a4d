A Nairobi court has allowed police to detain a man who claimed to be a messenger and spy at the Deputy President's office and attempted to extort money from activist Boniface Mwangi. The man, Douglas Nyakundi, delivered a letter to Mr Mwangi supposedly containing a confession by the alleged killers of businessman Jacob Juma. Senior Resident Magistrate Teresiah Nyangena issued the order to detain Mr Nyakundi for four days after police officers sought more time to complete their investigations. The police told the court that the accused delivered the letter to Mr Mwangi and attempted to extort money from him, claiming he had been sent by his boss, a Mr Rono. Mr Mwangi recorded his conversation with Mr Nyakundi on his phone in the presence of his lawyer, and that subsequently led to his arrest on November 30. 'MURDER PLOT' The accused allegedly promised the activist that he would give him more details on who murdered the businessman and even introduce him to the actual killers. He wanted the activist to deposit an unspecified amount of money in his bank account so that he could leak to him details of an alleged plan to kill him through a stage-managed accident. The accused also allegedly promised to testify in a case where the activist has been sued for defamation by Deputy President William Ruto. Mr Nyakundi also claimed to be a spy at the Deputy President's office. He is expected to be charged with attempting to extort money from Mr Mwangi. Police are seeking to establish whether he indeed works in the office of the Deputy President as a messenger and the whereabouts of his alleged boss, Mr Rono. He will be detained at the Kilimani Police Station. Mr Jumaâ€™s bullet-riddled body was found in his car on Ngong Road on the night of May 5 this year. No one has been arrested in connection to the murder.
