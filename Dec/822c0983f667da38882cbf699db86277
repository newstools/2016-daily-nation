Siaya Senator James Orengo has alleged a plot by the Jubilee administration to rig next year’s polls by conniving with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). In a press statement sent to newsrooms on Sunday, he said there was a plot by both Jubilee and the IEBC to ensure that elections are not held under the recently passed electoral laws. “We must not let Jubilee get away with its plans. There are flagrant cases of misconduct by the IEBC and government agencies to ensure that elections are not held under the new laws,” he said. “Jubilee and IEBC have sponsored and instituted proceedings in the High Court to challenge the Election Laws (Amendment) Act 2016 using the same lawyers that featured in the presidential election petition of 2013,” added Mr Orengo. The ODM legislator also read malice in some of the officers linked to the malpractices of 2013 polls applying to be members of IEBC and the failure to begin prosecution of individuals involved in the “Chickengate” bribery scandal, despite their identities being known. He also accused the Jubilee administration of frustrating the implementation of the Election Act and its subsequent amendments, timelines agreed upon in an accord signed by Cord and Jubilee.
