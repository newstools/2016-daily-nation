The Rift Valley Council of Elders has asked Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to tone down his attacks on Deputy President William Ruto. The council patron, Mr Gilbert Kabage and secretary Mr Peter Charagu, further warned Mr Moi that the orchestrated campaign against the DP would fail. Mr Moi, who is also the Kanu boss, recently told President Uhuru Kenyatta to address the Rift Valley residents directly or forget their votes in the next elections. Senator Moi claimed the DP doesn’t respect fellow Rift Valley politicians and “thinks too highly of himself”. On Friday, the elders said in Nakuru that Mr Moi is not the authorised spokesperson of the Rift Valley residents and should concentrate his energies on reviving the ailing Kanu. Mr Kabage said the negative campaign against the DP by the Kanu boss is a crusade in futility as it is driven by “selfishness and envy”. He added Mr Moi was not happy with the development projects initiated by the Jubilee administration. The elders called on the senator to stop playing the role of a lone ranger and join the DP.
