The government must take stern measures against public officials once investigations reveal who is responsible for the errors of omission and commission that led to the horrendous road accident in Naivasha that has now claimed 43 innocent lives. Those found culpable should take responsibility and step down for failing to protect the lives of the road users who lost their lives on the eve of Jamhuri Day. For too long, public officials who fail to live up to the expectations that the public regards their office have gotten away with negligence, corruption and lethargy, the result of which has been a far too high death toll on our roads. Because of such inaction, Kenya has consistently failed to meet its aspiration of reducing road deaths to below 3,000. The government must take reaching this target one of the key performance requirements for officials to remain in office. Similarly, safety and law enforcement officials who use their positions for personal gain through corruption must be dealt with. Rarely are corrupt officials and officers jailed for their actions, some of which contribute to the high carnage on Kenyan roads. The government must send a clear signal that this will not be allowed. And it must take steps that the public can see.
