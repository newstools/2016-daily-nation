A lawyer was Thursday charged with stealing Sh10 million from a bank. Mr Daniel Peter Kinyanjui faced two counts of theft and handling stolen property. The lawyer, who appeared before Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Joyce Gandani, denied the charges filed. The charge stated that on June 13 at the Barclays Bank Plaza Cooperate Service Centre, jointly with another person already charged in court, stole Sh10 million. He was also charged with dishonestly keeping the Sh10 million in the D P Kinyanjui Advocates account knowing that the money had been stolen or improperly acquired. State prosecutor told Ms Gandani that the case against the city based lawyer will be joined with another which has been listed for hearing next year. Defence lawyers Cliff Ombeta and Kirathe Wandugi applied to have Mr Kinyanjui released on a personal bond saying “he is sickly having suffered two minor strokes and a life threatening ailment.” Mr Kinyanjui was released on a cash bail of Sh200,000 until January 31 next year. Meanwhile, a man was charged with stealing Sh49.6 million from his employer on diverse dates between January 1 and March 5, 2016. Mr James Roria Kimani is alleged to have committed the offence at Kamba Manufacturing 1986 Limited in Nairobi County. He denied the charge and was released on a cash bail of Sh1 million.
