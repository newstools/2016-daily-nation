The victory by Kenya women’s cricket team over United Arab Emirates on Monday was inspiring. Kenya beat UAE by five wickets to lift the UAE International Women’s T20 Cup at Sharjah Cricket Stadium and claim its maiden international victory. The victory comes a month after Kenya hosted Hong Kong in the fourth round of the ICC World Cricket League Championships. It was the first time the country was hosting an ICC-sanctioned fixture in four years. Kenya won the first match before the visitors turned the tables to win the second match. The UAE outing comes almost two months after Kenya hosted the Four-Nation One Day International Quadrangular Series in September featuring Kenya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Uganda. The outings by the two Kenyans teams clearly indicated that not all has been lost in cricket. The excitement created by the women’s victory and the turnout of over 2,000 fans in the tournaments in Nairobi shows that Kenya can redeem its image with proper structures and management of the game. It now calls for more resources for local cricket. Kenya had not been hosting ICC-sanctioned matches for four years owing to a security travel advisory. Kenya lost its ODI and T20I status in 2014.
