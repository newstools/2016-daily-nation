Performance appraisal for teachers have improved their delivery and quality of learning outcomes in schools, their employer has said. The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) launched the performance contracting and performance appraisal for head teachers and teachers respectively early this year targeting more than 290,000 teachers. TSC Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia in a statement said the commission was satisfied with its achievement this year. This year, TSC signed two Collective Bargaining Agreements with Kenya National Union of Teachers and Kenya union of Post Primary Education in June and October, bringing unprecedented industrial harmony to the education sector. “The Commission commends the leadership of Knut and Kuppet for their sacrifice, patience and focus on the bigger national duty of providing quality education to our children,” said Mrs Macharia. She also lauded teachers for ensuring that this year’s national examinations were conducted with the utmost integrity. “Many of them were involved as supervisors and examiners. In ensuring the honesty of Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), our teachers’ involvement in the examination process called for sacrifice beyond the call of duty,” said the CEO. She said the Commission will continue seeking ways of improving terms and conditions of service of teachers.
