BANGUI, Friday Displaced people in a tent city near Bangui airport in the Central African Republic have started returning home. Plans to evacuate the airport camp, where tens of thousands of people have taken refuge since the country’s conflict erupted in 2013, are dubbed “Home for Christmas”. At the peak of the crisis, nearly 80,000 people took shelter in the Mpoko camp. Many have since gone home, though nearly 30,000 remain. In a plan launched by President Faustin-Archange Touadera, the evacuation began on Thursday – spelling the end of a camp that visitors arriving at the airport would see minutes after landing. The vast majority of camp residents are from Bangui and so only have a few kilometres to cover to their homes. They sought refuge in the camp during a civil war that erupted in 2013 following the overthrow of long-serving president Francois Bozize – a Christian – by Muslim rebels from a coalition known as Seleka. The area near the airport was deemed safe because French soldiers and a United Nations peacekeeping mission (Minusca) had a presence there. “This is just the beginning of the operation. It concerns 28,000 people. Every day, displaced people living in at least one zone will go home and this will take at least 13 days,” Social Affairs Minister Virginie Baikoua said. People living in the camp said they were glad to go home, and hoped authorities and the UN would guarantee their safety. “It has been just over three years that I’ve been here with my family. We didn’t have the choice, faced with the violence and massacres,” tradeswoman Yvette Pandone Kitiye told journalists.
