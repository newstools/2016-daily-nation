A court has granted bail to a man who shot Ranalo Foods (or K'Osewe) owner William Osewe. Tom Mboya denied the attempted murder charge in a Milimani court. He is accused of trying to kill Mr Osewe and another man, Wilfred Ombunya Tembula. He was released on Sh300,000 cash bail. Mr Osewe was shot in the stomach after a quarrel on December 1 with Mr Mboya. Mr Mboya, a licensed firearm holder, surrendered to the police and was disarmed. Mr Osewe is being treated at the High Dependence Unit of a city hospital. Mr Tembula suffered gunshot wounds and is also being treated at a city hospital. Prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki told Senior Principal Magistrate Charity Oluoch on Friday that the accused attempted to murder the two at Garden Estate in Kasarani. Ms Mwaniki did not oppose the bail application by defence lawyer Jack Makenzi, who said the accused had been in police custody since the shooting. "I urge this court to exercise its discretion and release the suspect on a reasonable cash bail,‚Äù Mr Makenzie said. He added that the suspect had been cooperating with investigators since his arrest on December 1, and that he is not a flight risk. "He will abide [by] the terms which will be imposed on him," he said. The magistrate ordered Mr Mboya not to interfere with witnesses. "His bail will be cancelled once he defies the bail conditions," she said. The case will be heard on February 1, 2017.   His attacker, a licensed firearm holder, surrenders to the police and is disarmed.
