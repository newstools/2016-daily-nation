Ugandan tactician Paul Nkata has ditched Tusker for Bandari just a month after leading the brewers to the Kenyan Premier League title and GOtv Shield. Nkata, who joined the Brewers from Muhoroni Youth at the beginning of the 2016 season, is said to have terminated his remaining year in his contract and moved to the coastal based side in a shock move. “I can confirm that Nkata has left the club. I’m not sure which club he will be joining but he is not with us anymore,” said a source who cannot be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media on behalf of the club. Nkata led Tusker to their 11th league title and ended the club’s 23-year wait for the domestic title after edging out Ulinzi Stars 1-0 in the GOtv Shield final on October 20 at the Nyayo Stadium. Efforts to reach coach Nkata for comments proved futile as our calls went answered for the better part of Thursday evening.
