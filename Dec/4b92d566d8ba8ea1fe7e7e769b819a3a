Ugandan tactician George “Best” Nsimbe is favourite to take over the coaching reigns at Tusker, Daily Nation Sport can reveal. The experienced Nsimbe is in line to replace compatriot Paul Nkata who dramatically dumped the Ruaraka-based club Thursday evening. Nkata, who’s also managed City Stars and Muhoroni Youth in the SportPesa Premier League in the past two years, has since been appointed Bandari coach on a one-year deal. Tusker’s chief executive Charles Obiny confirmed Nkata’s departure to Daily Nation Sport on phone on Thursday night. Bandari and Nkata meanwhile, opted to remain mum when contacted. “He is no longer with us and we wish him well. The process of getting a replacement is already started. There is widespread interest especially from East Africa but I already have someone in mind,” Obiny stated. That person could be former Azam FC coach Nsimbe according to our sources at Ruaraka. Nsimbe, who won the Ugandan league title with Kampala City Council Authority, is said to be top of the shortlist drawn up by the decision makers at Tusker. Other coaches in the frame are former Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards coach Zdravko Logarusic, another Ugandan Sam Timbe, Rwandan Andrew Casa Mbungo and Chemelil Sugar coach Francis Baraza. Tusker, who won the league and domestic cup title this season, are looking to appoint a new coach immediately, so as to commence preparations for the new season in which the team will compete in the Caf Champions League. Another source at Ruaraka also intimated that Baraza, who is currently the Chemelil Sugar coach, will assist Nsimbe. The next Tusker coach will be their fifth tactician in as many seasons. Meanwhile, Nkata is believed to have been lured to Bandari by a lucrative financial offer, which tripled his estimated Sh100,000 monthly salary at Tusker.
