Coast Regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa on Friday said officials were aware of plans by criminal groups to disrupt peace. He also put on notice unnamed politicians he accused of sponsoring groups to cause violence and intimidate opponents ahead of the 2017 General Election. The administrator said such politicians risked being barred from contesting for any seat. “We are closely watching these groups. Whoever dares to cause insecurity will face the full force of the law,” he said in an interview with the Nation. “I ask young people not to be used to cause chaos. They should form meaningful groups and apply for loans to start businesses.” There are about 13 gangs in Mombasa and their members are aged 12 to 18, according to security sources. They mainly operate in Kisauni, Changamwe and Likoni. In Likoni, the knife-wielding gangs have been identified as Kapenguria Six, Wajukuu Wa Bibi, Young Thugs and Chafu. Kisauni has Wakali Kwanza and Wakali Wao, while Gaza and Spanish Spata gangs operate in Changamwe. Born To Kill, Vietnam, Akili Za Usiku, 64 Gang, Memory Gang, Watalia Gang, Crazy Boys and Mawayu terrorise residents of Old Town. Mr Marwa said most of the gangs had been tamed through cooperation between security agents and the public. The regional co-ordinator has previously linked some of the groups to politicians. Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba defended himself against accusations that he was funding Wakali Kwanza and Wakali Wao gangs and challenged anyone with evidence to produce it. Mr Bedzimba threatened to sue anyone linking him to the groups.
