Three legislators have recommended that health services be reverted to the national government as a way of restoring normalcy at hospitals. Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti, area Woman Representative Rose Mitaru and Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire said perennial industrial action by health workers and lack of essential drugs in public hospitals show that county governments had failed to manage the sector. Mr Kivuti urged the national government to honour the collective bargaining agreement it entered with doctors to end the ongoing strike by doctors and other health workers. Ms Mitaru said some counties were struggling with an acute shortage of health workers and it is only fair that the national government take back the role of hiring and deploying staff. She said some counties have also entrenched tribalism and discourage health workers from other regions from working in their hospitals. Speaking in Embu town on Thursday, Ms Mitaru and Mr Kivuti said changes are necessary as county governments have proved they are ill-prepared to manage health services. Addressing Riakanau residents at Gategi market, Ms Mbarire said the country made a mistake when it allowed county governments to take over such crucial services. She said the national government should manage health services until counties prove they can run them. Ms Mbabire, who has expressed interest in the Embu gubernatorial seat, said Level Four and Level Five hospitals should be run by Nairobi while health centres and dispensaries should be under counties. “What we are witnessing right now is total confusion,” she said.
