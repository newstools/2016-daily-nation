Police in Kisii County have recorded statements from a group of Administration Police officers suspected of shooting dead two women traders at Daraja Mbili market in Kisii Town on Thursday evening. County Commissioner Kula Hache, however, said no one had been arrested regarding the incident that sparked riots in the town. A number of business premises were broken into following the subsequent confrontation between the protesters and law enforcement officers.On Friday, Ms Hache said police had stepped up their investigations into the shootings. She said police had seized the officers' guns, which will be subjected to ballistic tests before they are taken to court. “All that we want is water-tight evidence before anyone is arrested… all we want is justice for the families of the two women killed,” said Ms Hache. 'CARELESS ALLEGATIONS' Meanwhile, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi has scoffed at reports on social media that officers from Deputy President William Ruto’s security detail were responsible for the shootings. “We are perturbed by these careless allegations levelled against the DP’s security officers. Let it be made clear that the incident took place three hours after the DP had left for another function,” Mr Maangi said. Ms Hache also confirmed that the shootings were committed by officers from the Kisii AP Camp. “Any information that it was the DP’s officers who were involved should be treated as a rumour,” she said. Later, the deputy governor and Ms Hache addressed residents at the Daraja Mbili market and appealed for calm as the police investigate the shootings.   The riots on Thursday night were sparked by the shooting of two people by police officers.
