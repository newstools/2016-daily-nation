Six people have been killed and 27 others rescued in an Al-Shabaab attack at Bulla public works in Mandera, Governor Ali Roba has confirmed. The attack occurred at 2:45am. "Out of 33 non-locals residing in one plot, six were shot dead and 27 rescued by our security officers manning the sector," Mr Roba said. In an interview with the Nation, Mr Roba added: "Six lives are too many to lose. We condemn the attack which comes at a time when locals had started enjoying peace." There was an explosion as police attempted to get into the house to retrieve the bodies, ripping off a roof. There were no injuries from the explosion. Police said landmines planted in the compound were delaying their attempts to retrieve the bodies of the dead. Bomb experts were expected to detonate the explosives. Mandera County Commissioner Frederick Shisia said a team was working to switch off communication networks to allow police to enter the building as they fear more explosives are in the house. Since the Garissa University College attack on April 2, 2015 that claimed 148 lives, mostly students, the country has experienced a lull in attacks. Attacks in border areas have been blamed on a porous frontier that assailants cross over easily to commit atrocities and slip back to the lawless Somalia.
