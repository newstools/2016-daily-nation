National Assembly Majority Leader Adan Duale has asked Mandera residents to report Al-Shabaab suspects to security authorities. Speaking during the coronation of Murule Clan leader in Mandera town on Saturday, Mr Duale said the terror outfit has caused a lot of damage in the North Eastern region. “As Mandera people, don’t allow Al-Shabaab to thrive and divide Kenyans along religion or tribe, report them to police for action,” he said. Mr Duale said national unity was Jubilee government’s priority. North Eastern Regional Coordinator Mohamud Saleh said calm has returned in the region, but there were a few incidents reported along the Kenya-Somalia border. “Security in this region has improved and what happened here last week should not create fear in those living in Mandera or wanting to come in. Mandera belongs to you and you have the responsibility to protect but not blame the government for insecurity,” Mr Saleh said. Last week, six people were killed and three injured when Al-Shabaab raided a residential plot in Mandera town. He said a special security arrangement by the national government will be implemented soon in Mandera County. “Mandera borders Ethiopia and Somalia making it critical but the national government is watching and very soon there will be changes,” he said.
