The decision by Siaya Governor Cornell Rasanga to put his portrait on the county's mock examination papers has generated mixed reactions among Kenyans on the social media. The county government has allocated Sh1.7 million for this year’s primary school mocks. All the examination papers bear the portrait of the governor. Some Kenyans on social media accused the governor of using the exam papers to campaign for re-election. Others wondered what value the governor's portrait would add to the papers or to the pupil sitting the exam. But Siaya education minister Pamela Okello supported the move, saying it aims to ensure that the “pupils know their governor and have a closer relation with him.” “The move to place the governor’s portrait on the examination papers is just,” she said. Speaking at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology on Tuesday, Ms Okello said the county government will do the same thing in subsequent years. “We are in the process of boosting the performance of our pupils and also as a campaign bid for Governor Rasanga in the next general election,” said Mrs Okello. She said close to 8,000 candidates seating this year’s examination will be given the papers. “Our campaign plan is good because even close relatives to the candidates will get to see the governor in the papers,” she said.
