Detectives from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (Eacc) have pitched tent at Afya House to probe Sh5 billion scam revealed in a leaked audit. The sleuths swung into action just a day after top ministry officials were put under pressure over the graft scandal. Senators on Thursday told Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu and his Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri to take responsibility of the mess. The duo was told to appear before the Senate health committee, chaired by Wilfred Machage, to explain how the money was irregularly paid to questionable companies and individuals. A leaked audit has showed that the Integrated Financial management Information System (Ifmis) was manipulated to allow payment of the billions of shillings.   Kenyans express outrage at Sh5 billion theft at Health ministry and PS's threats to journalist who uncovered the story.
