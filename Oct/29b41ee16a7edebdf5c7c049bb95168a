Scores of villagers in Kerio valley on Friday evening were fleeing their homes following a broad daylight cattle raid that interrupted a funeral in the area. Suspected cattle rustlers attacked Kasui village in the afternoon firing in the air as they escaped with livestock. Two MPs and a deputy governor who were in the funeral were among mourners who scampered for safety during the burial of Justine Kiptoo, who was killed this week. Speaking along Chesongoch -Chugor road while fleeing, MPs Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East), William Kisang (Marakwet West) and Deputy Governor Gabriel Lagat reminded President Uhuru Kenyatta that he took oath of office to protect the lives of all Kenyan citizens. "This is the reason why Kisang and I have said there is no point of being in Jubilee government anymore. We have buried people every weekend and raids are the order of the day," said Mr Bowen. A fleeing resident, Jacob Kibor, said sleeping in their homes was not safe because raiders could attack in the wee hours of the night. The Nation witnessed locals leaving the village with their belongings along Chugor-Chesoi-Chesongoch road headed to the unknown while others id in the bushes and caves.   Angry residents lashed out at the Media saying journalists were no longer of any help as they have been visiting the region but coverage was not satisfactory — to the residents — with some claiming that some media houses had been compromised and thus could not report about the sad state in the area. “We no longer even want newsmen because the pictures and the reporting they do does not go anywhere," said Mr Cornelius Kipkorir, a teacher at Kompasses Primary School. They regretted that the government had failed to address the raids that have left 16 people dead since May this year. Two burials for other rustling victims will be carried out on Saturday in the area.
