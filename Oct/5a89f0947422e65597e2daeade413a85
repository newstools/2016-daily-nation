Kenya’s Ibrahim Kibet and Gabon’s Celestine Avomo Ella warmed up for next month’s Africa Cup of Nations tournament by winning men and women’s titles in the October Series Tennis Championship at Nairobi Club on Sunday. Second seed Kibet saw off fifth seed Sheil Kotecha 7-6 (5) 6-3 in men’s final while Ella cruised to a routine 6-1, 6-3 win over Burundi’s Aisha Niyonkuru in the women’s affair. The two-day competition was organised by Tennis Kenya as a build-up tournament for national team players ahead of next month’s Africa Cup of Nations to be held at the same venue.  The men’s draw featured the top five that will fly the Kenyan flag in the November 7-13 competition. Top-seeded Kevin Cheruiyot fell victim to an impressive all-round performance from team mate Kotecha who won 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the quarter-finals. A powerful serve, ground strokes and an impressive net game lifted Kotecha past the current number one. Kotecha reached the final with a 6-0 6-1 win over Tanzania’s Emmanuel Mallya Nicodemo to set up a scintillating clash with his compatriot Kibet. Kibet was tearing opponents apart at the bottom of the draw, proving too strong for Burundi’s Mohamed Omar in the quarterfinals and Petty Andanda in the last four. The opening set of the final was an all-serve affair. Despite both players breaking each other’s serve in the first two games, subsequent holds led to an opening set tie break which Yego duly converted 7-3 to put the wind in his sails.  The second set was a similar affair and a service break at 4-4 put Yego on pole to serve for the match holding a 5-4 lead. “This was a perfect practice for the Nations Cup. He (Kotecha) gave me a good match. We are almost ready for next month’s event,” Kibet said.   The Series is a build-up for the national teams preparing for next month’s Africa Nations Cup.
