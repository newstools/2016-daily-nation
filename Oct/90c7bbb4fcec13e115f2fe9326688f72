Anti-graft agency sleuths raided the homes of Tharaka-Nithi Deputy Governor Murithi Mati and a retired chief and seized more than Sh2 million in fake currency. Tharaka-Nithi police boss Mary Omari said the money was found in retired chief Benson Ngoci's home. Mr Ngoci is a close ally of Dr Mati. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officers ransacked Dr Mati's and Mr Ngochi's homes in Tunyai, Tharaka-Nithi County. The detectives also raided Dr Mati's home in Kinoru, Meru. The detectives also searched a pharmacy in Meru belonging to the deputy governor's wife and confiscated Sh800,000 The wife, however, insisted the money was proceeds from the sale of drugs at the pharmacy. Dr Mati has been on the spot since he accused his police bodyguard of robbing him of Sh3.5 million at gunpoint. The case is in court. The deputy governorâ€™s bodyguard, Administration Police officer Josphat Kipyegon and Rose Kajira were on Friday released on a Sh2 million bond or a Sh500,000 cash bail each after they denied the charge. COOPERATED WITH TEAM An EACC officer had earlier told the Nation that Dr Mati cooperated with the team, who turned down cabinets in his Meru home looking for documents that could implicate him in irregularities. "However, we didn't find useful leads," said the officer, who asked not to be named as he is not allowed to speak to the media. The deputy county boss is said to have attracted the attention of the EACC after the incident for carrying home a large amount of cash. He told police the Sh3.5 million was paid to him after he sold land in Kathwana. Some Tharaka-Nithi politicians had also asked for Dr Mati, a former teacher, to be investigated over his rapid rise to riches. Previously, police had repulsed a gang that had raided Dr Mati's home in Tharaka-Nithi to steal Sh20 million said to have been stashed in sacks. A number of people were arrested and charged in court.
