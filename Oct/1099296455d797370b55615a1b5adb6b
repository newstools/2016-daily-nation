Mobile money transfer service M-Pesa is experiencing a technical hitch but Safaricom has said a team is working to solve the problem. On its Twitter page, the company said: "We're experiencing transaction delays with M-Pesa service. We're working to resolve the issue. Apologies for inconvenience." The problem, if it persists, is likely to lead to questions about the benefits of Safaricom's decision to move the M-Pesa server to Kenya from Germany last year and then upgrading it. Prior to April 2015, users frequently complained about transaction delays, especially on weekends and holidays. The delays were attributed to the capacity of the server, which was said to handle only 320 transactions per second. However, after the overhaul, Kenyans made transactions worth Sh4.1 billion last year, almost double the Sh2.8 billion exchanged in 2014, and the firm expanded its customer base.
