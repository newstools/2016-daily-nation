Harambee Stars will be without their inspirational skipper Victor Wanyama when they clash with Congo’s Red Devils in an international friendly match on Tuesday in Kinshasa. Football Kenya Federation on Saturday explained that Wanyama, who plies his trade with English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur has been omitted from the quad in the interest of his fitness. “Subsequently, following the deliberation between Harambee Stars technical bench and their Tottenham counterparts, a decision has been made not to have Wanyama come for the friendly,” FKF’s Communications and Publics Relations Manager, Barry Otieno, told Sunday Nation Sport. “Since Wanyama will be in action on Sunday (today) against Manchester City. It would be physically demanding for him play two games in under 48 hours and in two continents. This decision has been made in Wanyama’s best interest,” Otieno said. Wanyama has hard a fine start at White Hart Lane, featuring prominently at the base of Spurs  midfield and is expected to play a prominent role in today’s top billed clash with Pep Guardiola’s table-topping Manchester City. Travelling to Congo would have meant that the combative midfielder cover thousands of miles just hours after the EPL game and back to London after Tuesday’s clash. Stars camp got a boost following the arrival of Zambia-based trio of David “Calabar” Owino, Anthony “Teddy” Akumu and Jesse Were. All turn out for Zambian giants  Zesco United. They are part of the 20-man squad that will jet out tomorrow morning for Congo. Stars coach Stanley Okumbi is using the match to keep his boys active after they fell flat in their bids to qualify for next year’s African Cup of Nations finals to be held in for Gabon, and the Russia 2018 Wor
