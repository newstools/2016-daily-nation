Two women were shot dead by police at Daraja Mbili market in Kisii Town, Kisii County, in evening chaos after boda boda operators blocked the Kisii-Kisumu highway. According to eyewitness Dennis Ogero, police officers driving along the highway stopped to disperse the riders parked alongside the road. A fight between the police and the operators broke out, leading to the women getting shot. Edna Osoro, 27, was selling tomatoes when she was struck and killed. The officers had a hard time trying to retrieve the body. Her death, along with that of another woman yet to be identified, sparked off chaotic scenes as stone-throwing protesters engaged police in running battles. Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital (KTRH) chief executive Enoch Ondari said the woman died on arrival at the facility. Ms Osoro's father, John Osoro, was inconsolable as he wept over the death of his daughter. "I have just seen the worst day of my life. How could my daughter die in such an unnecessary manner?" He said. Police finally managed to retrieve Ms Osoro's body at 9:30pm. They also partially removed the burning barricades on the highway before taking the body to the KTRH morgue.
