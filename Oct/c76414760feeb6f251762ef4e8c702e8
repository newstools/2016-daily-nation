Police are holding 35 Ethiopians arrested during an anti-human trafficking operation on the outskirts of Nairobi on Tuesday night. The 9pm operation was carried out in Ruai, where the aliens were found in a cramped house, whose owner is still being sought by police. Nairobi County police commander Japheth Koome said two of those in custody are aged between 35 and 40 years and the rest are between 20 and 25 years old. “The problem we have is that none of them can speak either English or Kiswahili. So we are looking for an interpreter so that we are able to interrogate them,” he said. Mr Koome added that they would be presented in court with the aim of getting orders to continue holding them before charging them, most likely for being in Kenya illegally. However, police are looking for the owner of the house and others who facilitated their travel into the country so that they can face human trafficking charges in court. Police believe the aliens were in transit to southern Africa, because it is the most common route used to smuggle people from Ethiopia to Europe.
