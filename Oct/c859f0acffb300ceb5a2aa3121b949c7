Philip Kibungei, 22, and former World Half Marathon bronze medallist Pascaliah Jepkorir on Saturday braved chilly conditions to win the 26th edition of University of Eldoret (Chepkoilel) Cross Country. Yesterday’s race was being used as warm-up by a number of athletes, who are scrambling for positions in the Kenya Team for the 2017 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Uganda. The forthcoming seven-tier Athletics Kenya Cross Country meetings will be used to pick the national team. Kibungei, who hails from Lower Moiben in Uasin Gishu County but trains in Iten, won his first race in 30min 09.6 seconds to lift the men’s 10km senior title. Fredrick Kipkosgei (30:11.2) and Emmanuel Bor (30:17.8) took second and third positions. “I feel very happy to have won my first race. After finishing third at Chabara Cross Country two weeks ago,” said Kibungei. “I hope this form takes me past the national trials and earn me a ticket to the World cross country championships in Uganda next year. It has always been my dream to run for my country.” The women’s 8km senior race saw Jepkorir eclipse her sixth position from Ndalat Cross Country, winning in 26:59.7 ahead of Winnie Jepkorir who finished second in 27:11.5 and Jackline Atundonya (27:13.5). “My performances have not been good in the past one and half years. But I’m glad my form is slowly improving. My focus now is the World Cross Country Championships,” said Jepkorir, who hails from Kapchumba village in Nandi County. Jepkorir, who also emerged fourth at the 2016 World Half Marathon in Cardiff, Wales in March this year, said she is in form. She also hopes to grab a slot in the national team for 2017 World Cross Country Championships in Uganda. She placed sixth at Family Bank Half Marathon two weeks ago. Reigning World Cross Country champion Agnes Jebet finished seventh. Jebet was using the race as part of her training schedule as she makes a return after a lengthy lay off with a fibula injury. KIMELI TOPS JUNIOR RACE Nicholas Kimeli won the men’s 8km junior race. Kimeli, third in Ndalat Cross, clocked 23:5.0 as Peter Lang’at and Vincent Kiprotich occupied the other two podium slots in 24:08.3 and 24:14.4 respectively. “The conditions favoured me today. The weather was almost the same as that in my Iten training base and therefore, I did not have much trouble keeping the pace,” Kimeli said. Form One student Ann Nyagothie produced a sterling run to win the women’s 6km race.
