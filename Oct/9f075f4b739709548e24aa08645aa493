Efforts by Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki to make Tharaka-Nithi County a Jubilee Party zone seems to have hit a deadlock as a number of politicians opt for other parties. As Prof Kindiki drummed up support for the new party in Tharaka North on Sunday, a number of MCAs, led by Zachary Mpanda (Chiakariga ward), preached anti-Jubilee slogans in Tharaka South. Speaking in Mukothima, Prof Kindiki said contestants in smaller parties in the Mount Kenya region will be wasting their time because they will automatically lose. He said no one should divide Jubilee Party votes in the region by contesting on other parties. “Every politician in Mount Kenya region should join Jubilee Party and those who will lose at nominations accept defeat and support winners,” Prof Kindiki said. But Mr Mpanda said the creation of a single party is a clear indication of a leadership that does not believe in democracy. “Taking the country back to a single party is a pure betrayal of democracy that we have struggled to get for many years,” Mr Mpanda said. He urged locals to scrutinize the contestants' ability to deliver and not the party they are contesting on. “Last election we made a mistake and voted in parties instead of personalities in our county and we regret the consequences,” he said.
