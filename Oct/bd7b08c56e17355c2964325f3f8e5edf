Some residents of Ainamoi constituency have prepared two petitions to present to the National Assembly opposing the appointment of Court of Appeal Judge David Maraga as the new Chief Justice. The residents based their petitions on a ruling delivered by Justice Maraga in a case on the killing of David Kimutai Too, then Ainamoi MP. The judge, then based at the High Court in Nakuru, reduced the murder charge against the accused to manslaughter and jailed him for 10 years. The accused, Andrew Moeche Omwenga, was charged with killing Mr Too and traffic police officer Eunice Chepkwony in Eldoret town on January 31, 2008. The petitions have been prepared by Emmanuel Korir, a parliamentary aspirant, and Tom Biegon, an aide to Ainamoi MP Benjamin Langat. Mr Langat is a younger brother of Mr Too. He won the seat in a by-election held in 2008 and retained it in the 2013 polls. The State appealed against Justice Maraga’s ruling and the case is pending at the Court of Appeal. Justice Maraga is expected to appear before a parliamentary committee Wednesday after President Uhuru Kenyatta forwarded his name to the National Assembly following his nomination by the Judicial Service Commission. Mr Biegon said the people of Ainamoi were aggrieved by the ruling and will ask Parliament to reject his appointment. In his petition, Mr Korir has urged the National Assembly to reject the nomination of Justice Maraga. “The humble petitioners pray that the National Assembly does not approve his nomination to become Chief Justice and compels Justice Maraga to make an apology to the family of the deceased, the people of Ainamoi Constituency and the people of Kenya at large for his indiscretion and failure to uphold the Constitution,” reads part of the petition.
