Four people died and four others were injured in two separate accidents on Sunday night in Nyeri County. The first crash happened on the Naro Moru-Nanyuki highway when a car collided with a lorry it was trying to overtake, killing two people on the spot. Two other occupants of the car were rushed to Nanyuki County Referral Hospital but died while receiving treatment. The driver of the lorry and his turnboy sustained minor injuries for which they were treated and discharged. Two of the deceased were an uncle and his nephew while the other two were their neighbours in Aguthi Village, less than four kilometres from the scene of the accident. In another incident, a truck driver and his conductor narrowly escaped death after the driver lost control while navigating a sharp corner on the Nyeri-Karatina highway at Wairuta shopping centre. The truck overturned on the busy section, blocking the road for hours. It was transporting sugar to Mount Kenya Coca-Cola Bottlers in Nyeri when the accident happened. Administration Police officers were deployed to the scene to secure the cargo from looting by a huge crowd that had gathered there. Residents called for the erection of bumps on the section, saying many crashes had occurred there. "We have schools and a shopping centre around and with an increase in accidents, we fear for our lives," said James Githogo, a resident.
