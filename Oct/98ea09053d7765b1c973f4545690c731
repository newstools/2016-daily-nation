A searing header from burly Ghanaian import Stephen Owusu five minutes from time is all that Tusker needed to overcome a stubborn Bandari 1-0 win at the Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa on Saturday. Tusker showed grit and character to break the dockers’ resistance to keep alive their hopes of a first league title in four years. The win hauled the Brewers’ points tally to 51, opening up a seven-point lead over closest challengers Gor Mahia, who are on 44 points and with a game in hand. Owusu, who had barely came onto the pitch, made a perfect run to meet a long cross from ageless Osborne Monday and made no mistake. At the Ruaraka grounds in Nairobi, Posta Rangers and Kakamega Homeboyz fought to a dour barren draw. The match lived to its billing as a tough clash. In the early exchanges, Homeboyz made two forced substitutions after dangerman Ali Bhai and Moses Mudavadi were both stretched off. Posta came close to finding the mark in the 10th through the talismanic Timothy Otieno, who faltered with only Homeboyz custodian Michael Wanyika to beat. Later on at the same venue, both City Stars and Thika United were reduced to 10 men after Jimmy Bageya and Sammy Mejja were red-carded in a duel that Thika won 1-0. Skipper Dennis Odhiambo scored a penalty in the 86th minute. At Kasarani, visiting Chemelil Sugar clinched a 2-1 win over a free-falling Ushuru. Jared Obwoge was the millers’ golden boy of the afternoon, claiming a first half brace to ensure three points for the  sugar milers while  Gambian import Ebrima Sanneh pulled a consolation for the  taxmen, whose  stocks have continued to fall this  term. At the Awendo Green Stadium, Juma Masoud’s powerful volley in the 70th minute was the difference as Sony Sugar beat visiting Sofapaka 1-0. The win condemned the basement boys to their 18th defeat of the season as the reality of relegation looms while for Sony, the three vital points helped the millers leapfrog Muhoroni to ninth position with 35 points.
