Starring Madina Nalwanga, Lupita Nyong’o and David Oleyowo Queen of Katwe is the Disney rendition of the real life story of Phiona Mutesi, one of Uganda’s most accomplished female chess champions who has represented her country across the world. Brought up in the slum of Katwe, she found a way out for her and her family by learning how to play chess, even before she learned to read and write, with help from her committed coach and her mother, who wanted her to have a life beyond that of selling maize. I watched this movie last week at Planet Media Westgate Cinema, and really enjoyed it. As expected, it is a tear-jerker. I loved that they kept the soundtrack predominantly African, so there was a lot of “Africanness” in the story - in the mannerisms of the actors, and in the humour too. Disney did well with this one. Go see it for a little inspiration.
