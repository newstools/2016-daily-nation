Two Nyeri County officials were charged Tuesday with illegally awarding a Sh30 million contract to Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). Former Agriculture Executive Shadrack Mubea and current Agriculture Chief Officer David Nyaga were charged before Nyeri Principal Magistrate Philip Mutua Wambua with abuse of office. They were charged that on July 14, 2014 in Nyeri County, they jointly used their offices to award an inflated contract of Sh30 million to JKUAT Enterprises Ltd. The award was for an investigative audit to review liabilities to coffee societies in Nyeri County. Mr Mubea and Mr Nyaga, however, denied the charges. Through their lawyers Muthui Kimani and Kimani Njuguna, they asked the court to release them on lenient bond terms. They were released on a Sh5 million bond each with a surety of a similar amount, with an alternative cash bail of Sh1 million each. The two were arrested on Monday afternoon and detained at the Nyeri Central Police Station before there were released on police bail. The case will be heard on November 29, 2016.
