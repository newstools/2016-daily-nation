As Paragon has been a trend-setter for Ngong, radiating preponderance on every occasion. The Lord McMillan Cup is his current venture where he dares mostly older horses like Maasai King, Belo Horizonte, Public Hero, and, Knighthood, to try a tackle. Curiously, Lesley Sercombe rides Knighthood, swerving from her customary Nutcracker suite. Readers are reminded to tune into Flemington, Tuesday morning, 7.00 am, for the 3,200m Melbourne Cup. Curren Mirotic, Bondi Beach, Jameka, and, Exospheric, are our final four rating-analysis, although there are a smart handful of 20 to chose from. How about Ari G changing from marathons to a Jim Kidman Bowl Sprint? It should provoke some crispy impetuosity by way of a drastic change, but, Espionage, Drumlargan and Flash Harry, might already have other ideas.
