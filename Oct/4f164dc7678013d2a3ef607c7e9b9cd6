The controversial Sh6.8 billion project meant to increase water supply in Nairobi will proceed as planned, Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) chief executive Malaquen Milgo has said. Mr Milgo on Friday dismissed claims that the Northern Collector Tunnel (NCT), which is being built by AWSB, will harm the environment. He said the project was subjected to public review and an impact assessment study and research were done indicating there would be no impact on the flow of rivers.

He added: “Most importantly we urge all partners and stakeholders to support the implementation of the NCT1 and other subsequent projects to be implemented under the Nairobi Water Masterplan.” Mr Milgo said once the project is completed, the supply of water to Nairobi residents will rise by 140,000 cubic metres per day. He said the host county will derive benefits through the implementation of community water projects. Already, Mr Milgo said, the government has spent Sh4.4 billion to finance projects in Murang’a County. The project, partly funded by the World Bank, has caused controversy, with critics arguing that it would turn parts of central Kenya and areas where the River Tana traverses into deserts.
