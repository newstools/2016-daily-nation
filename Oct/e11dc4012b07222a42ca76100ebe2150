Five colleges offering middle-level training in Nairobi were on Tuesday shut down. The Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority (TVET) closed the colleges for non-compliance with the registration and accreditation requirements. Technical Institute, Regional Institute, Céfored Institute of Relief and Development, Bonjour Institute and East African Institute were closed for non-compliance with set standards and guidelines. The authority’s director-general, Mr Kipkirui Langat, said their mandate is to inspect, license, register and accredit training institutions and as part of the agenda, they have decided to close non-compliant institutions. “The closure of non-compliant institutions underscores the authority’s goal of meeting the Vision 2030 by providing market driven, competent skilled work force with recognised training and certification,” said Dr Langat. “The authority will continue with its inspection and licensing of all the TVET institutions and accreditation of programmes.” The director said the closure of those found to be non-compliant would enable Kenyans to access quality education in registered and chartered institutions, thus ensuring the country properly educated citizens. During the crackdown, done in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, Technical and Regional institutes were found to be offering medical laboratory technology courses that were not licensed, he said. The other three colleges had been offering middle-level training without applying for registration and accreditation from the authority. The campaign started on Tuesday and is targeting more than 100 institutions across the country offering middle-level training illegally.
