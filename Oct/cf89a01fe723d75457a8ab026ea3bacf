Auditor-General Edward Ouko has asked Parliament to block budgetary allocations to ministries and counties that fail to account for funds given to them. Mr Ouko challenged lawmakers to use audit reports to ensure money is managed and used properly. â€œThe audit reports should be a constant reference when Parliament is apportioning funds," he said. He said allocating money to a ministry or county based on how it used cash allocated to them previously would improve services. Mr Ouko was speaking Wednesday during the launch of the Guide to Understanding National and County Audit Reports at the Sarova Stanley hotel in Nairobi.
