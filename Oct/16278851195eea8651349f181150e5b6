Kenya Rugby Union will in the course of the week unveil the new Kenya Sevens head coach. Interviews for the coach among 15 applicants ended on Friday. The rugby fraternity is waiting eagerly to see who will be picked to guide the team during the 2016-2017 World Rugby Sevens Series. Under head coach Benjamin Ayimba, the team won its maiden World Rugby Sevens Series event in Singapore, although it later had a disastrous outing during the Rio Olympic Games. Those who wish Kenya’s rugby well expect that the board will follow due diligence in selecting the most suitable candidate for the post. The person picked should be qualified, honest, and full of integrity besides commanding respect from the players. The previous selection was marred by controversy even though Ayimba went on to guide the team to the historic show in Singapore. However, events leading to the Rio Olympics and even afterwards, with allegations of bribery, with some technical bench members allegedly demanding money from players in order to be selected to the team, have marred the good run. That is why many want to see new faces on the technical bench to restore the integrity of the team. The new coach will bear the responsibility of not only producing good results but also winning back the confidence of the players.
