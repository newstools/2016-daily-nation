A man and his son were killed on Monday night at Burat in Isiolo County. The heads of the victims, Stephen Ekiru, 51, and his seven-year-old son, were severed in their house by the unknown assailants. Isiolo police commander Charles Ontita said the bodies also had deep cuts. Mr Ekiru's genitals were also "chopped off and pinned on a tree, about 30 metres from their homestead," said Mr Ontita. The boy's head is said to have been hacked off by a sharp object but remained attached to the body. The police boss said marks on the boy's body also suggested he might have been strangled. The bodies were taken to the Isiolo Hospital mortuary. Mr Ontita added that police were already investigating the murders. Paul Edong'a, a resident, claimed the man had earlier separated from his wife and was living with his son.
