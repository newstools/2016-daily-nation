Three university students and a tour guide who went missing in the Aberdare forest on Saturday have been rescued. The students have been airlifted to Nairobi for medical check-ups while the tour guide has been rushed to JM Memorial Hospital in Olkalou. The students - Rachel Ng'endo, Kelvin Kimani and Eunice Wanjiru - and tour guide Joseph Mwangi were found alive but very exhausted. A joint search team was carried out by police and the Kenya Wildlife Service using two helicopters. Kipipiri OCPD Charles Rotich said the four were among a group of 60 people on a hiking excursion in the Nyandarua County forest.   The excursion was organised by a Nairobi-based tour company and police say it was drizzling when the four went missing. The group realised the four were missing after they assembled at the departure point in Geta, Kipipiri. Some of the hikers remained in Geta to assist in the search while the rest returned to Nairobi.
