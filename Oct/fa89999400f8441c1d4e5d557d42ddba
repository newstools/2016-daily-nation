I love Kevin James on TV. In movies, not so much â€“ the slapstick always goes a bit too far for me, a la Grown Ups. But King Of Queens was hilarious, as is Kevin Can Wait. This is about a firefighter who retires and tries to get back into the groove of actually being around the house (and noticing how little he had to do with it), dealing with the changes in the lives of his three children, and trying to make his retirement buddies, also ex-firefighters, do all of the fun things they said they would do once they left employment. The humour is predictable sometimes, but the deviations they make to go ever-so-slightly off centre make this laugh-out-loud comedy, and the laugh track worth it.
