The move by Athletics Kenya to select coaches for national teams picked for the various international assignments in the new season is laudable. The athletes require support, and assigning them coaches early enough is a sure way of priming them up for good performance and restating Kenya’s power on the track. Early preparations and planning are key to the teams’ success hence the selected coaches must get down to work immediately. Kenyan athletes performed well at the World Championships last year in Beijing and the Rio Olympic Games — and these were largely due to effective training and preparation. That experience should be replicated in the next season. The coaches include experienced tactician Julius Kirwa, who will lead Team Kenya for the 2017 London World Championships in August. Others are Juma Ndiwa, who takes charge of the World Cross Country Championships scheduled for March; George Macharia, who leads the World Relays team, and Gikonyo Kariuki leading the World Under-18. Kirwa and company will require support from AK, the athletes, fellow coaches and the government if they are to succeed. Even more importantly, the preparation must go beyond coaching to include tackling other critical logistical issues that normally affect our teams when they go to compete out there.
