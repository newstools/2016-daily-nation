Two law students at a private university allegedly tried to bribe their way onto the graduation list for a whopping Sh820,000. Jecinta Mugure and Joan Kariuki of Catholic University of Eastern Africa were charged in the Anti-Corruption Court on Wednesday. The two are alleged to have offered the money to Deputy Registrar of Academic Affairs Caleb Opwora so that their names could be included on last month’s list of graduates. According to the prosecution, the two committed the offence on October 27, a day before graduation day at the main campus in Nairobi. “They wanted to be allowed to graduate with degrees in law they did not qualify for,” said the prosecution. Ms Mugure and Ms Kariuki denied the charges and were released on a bond of Sh300,000 each and a surety of the same amount. The two were arrested by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers on October 27. The case will be mentioned on November 28.
