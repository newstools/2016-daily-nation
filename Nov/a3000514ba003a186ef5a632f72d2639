Nairobi County Assembly has recommended the immediate sacking of County Secretary Robert Ayisi over a disputed office space between the House and the Executive. In a motion passed on Tuesday, Members of County Assembly unanimously faulted a row on the House's occupancy of City Hall's North Wing. Minority Leader Abdi Guyo, who sponsored the motion, said that a KenyaGazette notice dated September 11, 2015 stated that the County Assembly’s precincts included the whole North Wing from the basement to fifth floor but the executive have refused to move out from the fourth floor, fifth floor and the basement. The row escalated after the county secretary took the Assembly to court, a move that angered the House. He said that despite having a meeting to resolve the issue, he had moved to court to forcibly evict them from City Hall. “Despite mutual agreement and giving sufficient notice for vacation of premises reserved for the Assembly the county secretary went to court behind the county assembly to obtain orders to continue renovating 4th floor of the North Wing,” Mr Guyo said.
