Ten athletes have sued to to stop the constitutional review process and registration of the national athletics governing body, Athletics Kenya. In the court papers, the athletes have sued Athletics Kenya (AK) officials, the Sports Cabinet secretary, the Sports Registrar and that of societies as well as the Attorney-General. The athletes said the Sports Act is meant to harness sports development, promote a drug-free environment for sportsmen and women as well as help to set up sports facilities. They claim the Act requires a sports organisation to be registered and one that will be open to the public in its leadership as well as membership. The Act requires sports federations to register afresh and put in place a new constitution in line with the new requirements. According to the athletes, AK started a process to review its constitution so as to be in line with the Act and even held an annual general meeting (AGM) last year. But they are in court challenging the manner in which the process is being undertaken. They claimed the process is shrouded in secrecy and there have been no consultations with key stakeholders. They now want the court to declare that all athletes are entitled to be members of AK in their individual capacity and that Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario be compelled to form a committee to preside over the review process. They also want a temporary order issued to stop registration of AK and its current executive committee members be barred from embarking further on the review process. They further want to be furnished with copies of the AGM minutes as well as the amended constitution.
