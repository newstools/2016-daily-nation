A Form Four candidate from a secondary school in Narok is recuperating in hospital after he drank a lethal chemical. Speaking from his hospital bed, the 18-year-old student said he and his colleagues took the lab chemical after their Chemistry paper on Friday. According to his mother, Josphine Lankenua, he didn't sit for the Biology paper on Monday, because he could not see, speak or eat. Ms Lankenua said the examination paper was brought to the hospital in order for his son to write it but he was unable to do so due to his condition. The student was taken to Narok Cottage Hospital before he was referred to Nakuru Level Five Hospital. Nursing Officer Teresiah Mungai said the student was given beer as an antidote to neutralize the ethanol he had taken and was responding well to treatment. "He is in [a] stable condition and there's a high chance of him regaining sight since an eye specialist has attended to him," she said. Ms Lankenua, who learned about her son's condition on Monday, complained that the school had not given her any information about her son until Monday, when he was being transferred to Nakuru. She urged the Ministry of Education to probe the matter and also consider allowing his son to sit for the paper he missed.
