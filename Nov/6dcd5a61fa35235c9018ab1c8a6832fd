Residents of the remote Kiwayu Island in Lamu County have for the first time had access to piped water. The county government spent Sh9 million in the 2015/2016 financial year to provide water to the area that is just 45 kilometres from Somalia. Village headman Shali Shee Monday said it was a monumental event, particularly for women who trekked for many kilometres in search of water. Mrs Heiba Lali Vavo, a resident, echoed the headman’s sentiments. “We used to fetch water from wells two kilometres away and this often made us sick,” the 36-year-old woman said. “Our lives revolved around looking for water.” In Kizingitini Island, the problem has also been resolved following the setting up of a desalination plant. A women leader, Nyamwenye Mudhar, said residents used to rely on rainwater. Governor Issa Timamy said his administration would roll out a plan to take water to all remote parts of the Lamu archipelago.
