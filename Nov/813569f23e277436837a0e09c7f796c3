The voters’ register to be used in the upcoming Gor Mahia elections will be published on Wednesday. The board to oversee the election concluded the scrutiny and verification of the register on Sunday. The long delayed election have now been scheduled for December 11. Club organising secretary David Kiilo on Sunday confirmed that more than 4,820 people had registered for the elections, and that the deadline for aspirants to register will elapse at 5pm on Monday. Kiilo, who is running for the vice chairman’s position, told Daily Nation Sport that the current office is interested in conducting credible elections under the amended constitution and in accordance with the Sports Act. “There was an elaborate roadmap set by the electoral board and everything is moving according to schedule except for the registration of aspirants which has been extended by a day. “Once the voters’ register is announced and the nomination of aspirants concluded we shall allow at least one week for campaigns. “The election date remains December 11 at the Safaricom Stadium and we are putting everything in place to ensure that the process is free and fair,” he said. A four-man committee headed by Justice Nicholas Ombija was constituted to handle the verification process, although the club confirmed that the actual election will be conducted by an independent body. The registration of voters ended on November 21, and was conducted online. A number of aspirants have declared interests in the various elective seats. Incumbent chairman Ambrose Rachier is expected to defend his seat. Rachier, who was elected in January 19 2014, has Dan Oketch and Chris Omondi as his strongest challengers, although the incumbent still enjoys considerable support at the club.
