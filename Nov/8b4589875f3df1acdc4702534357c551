MANCHESTER Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands for angrily kicking a water bottle during his side's Premier League home game with West Ham United on Sunday. With the score 1-1, Mourinho took his displeasure out on a plastic bottle standing beside his technical area after Paul Pogba was booked for diving by referee Jonathan Moss. It is the second time Mourinho has been sent to the stands during a game this season, following his dismissal at half-time of United's recent 0-0 draw at home to Burnley. The Portuguese, 53, received a one-match touchline ban as punishment. He received a fine earlier this month after discussing Anthony Taylor's suitability to referee his side's league game at Liverpool. Mourinho had a run-in with Moss during the final weeks of his tenure as Chelsea manager last season. Mourinho confronted Moss at half-time after being sent to the stands during a 2-1 loss at West Ham and was hit with a one-game stadium ban by the Football Association.
