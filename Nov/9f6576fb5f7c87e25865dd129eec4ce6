Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua now risks arrest for failing to honour a Senate committee's summons. The Public Accounts and Investments Committee on Thursday resolved to write to Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet to arrest Dr Mutua and present him before it on Monday. The House team had summoned Dr Mutua to respond to audit queries after he failed toÂ appear before the committee on previous occasions. IMPEACHMENT MOTION The committee members, led by their vice-chairman John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot, Kanu), said the governor was taking the Senate for granted. Prof Lonyangapuo said it was illogical for Dr Mutua to claim he was asked to provide documents for the Meru County executive instead of Machakos. The governor, in his response, also said he was unable to attend because he was dealing with an impeachment motion against him.   31 MCAs, who reportedly travelled to Dar to defeat motion, miss the session.
