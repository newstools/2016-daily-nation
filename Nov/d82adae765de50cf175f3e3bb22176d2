Two university students have been arrested at the Makadara Private Centre in Nairobi after being found sitting Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams for others. One of the suspects, Alice Ahunyesi, was sitting the exam for her sister Scholastica Wanjiru, a businesswoman who had reportedly travelled to Ghana to purchase goods for her shop. The other suspect, Salome Onduso, a Kenyatta University student, was said to have been paid Sh10,000 by Anne Erastus to take the exams for her. A male student from the University of Nairobi was also arrested after police were told he had introduced Ms Onduso to Ms Erustus. Buruburu police division commander Geoffrey Mayek on Wednesday said police had received information from Leseno Madaga and Moenga Nyaga, a supervisor and invigilator at the centre, respectively, that the two looked like impersonators. Detectives went to the centre and questioned the two, who later confessed. The main suspects had by Wednesday evening not been arrested. Mr Mayek said the three suspects were in custody and would be charged in court on Thursday.
