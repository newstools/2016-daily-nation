Two people have died on the spot after two trucks collided head on at Mirera on the Mai Mahiu-Naivasha highway. According to a Kenya Red Cross official, the driver of a truck coming from the Mai Mahiu direction lost control and rammed into trailer-truck headed in the opposite direction. The official said the truck driver might have dozed off and lost control of his vehicle before the collision happened. “The driver and an unidentified passenger died on the spot, while the trailer-truck driver and his loader escaped with injuries,” said the official. The two were rushed to the Naivasha Sub-County Hospital for treatment. Among the first people to arrive at the scene was Jeremiah Mwangi, who said it took several hours to remove the two bodies trapped in the wreckage. Pastor Joseph Maina, who was driving along the route, said he assisted to rescue the injured driver and loader. “It was a grisly scene and it took some time to rescue the injured driver and loader,” he said. Residents said they heard a loud bang at around 4am and rushed to the scene of the accident. Some of the villagers engaged in a looting spree, carting away cardboards that were strewn on the road. It took the intervention of police to stop the theft as curious onlookers milled around the scene of the accident. The scene was littered with sand and cardboards, and it took police several hours to clear the road and allow traffic to flow.
