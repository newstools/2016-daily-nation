A High Court judge has ordered Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho to be jailed for three months after he failed to honour a court summons. Justice George Odunga ordered the Inspector-General of Police to ensure Mr Kibicho is arrested and sent to prison to serve the sentence. The judge pointed out that court orders should be respected and that any disobedience should not be tolerated. Justice Odunga said Mr Kibicho failed twice to honour a summons to appear in court to explain why a torture victim, who was awarded compensation after suing 13 years ago, had not been paid. The PS had been asked to appear Monday and Tuesday. On the first day, his lawyer told the court that he was attending a meeting and could therefore not make it. There was no explanation for his failure to show up on Tuesday. The summons was issued in a case where Michael Mahugu sought compensation from the State in 2003. He claimed he was tortured by Special Branch officers in then President Daniel Moi's regime and was awarded Sh2.6 million on February 2014. He then sued the Interior PS after his attempts to get the compensation failed.
