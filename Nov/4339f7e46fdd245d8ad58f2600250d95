Opposition leader, Raila Odinga Tuesday evening arrived in Mombasa for a four-day day tour, days after Deputy President William Ruto was in the region on a charm offensive. Mr Odinga, in a brief stopover near the Moi International Airport in Changamwe, tore into the Jubilee administration accusing it of being behind a cartel interfering with the integrated financial management information system (IFMIS) to steal millions of public money. “They have now brought something called IFMIS which they are using to steal. That is why we are telling Jubilee to keep off corruption because it has now become their other name,” said Mr Odinga. He added: “When they were done with the National Youth Service (NYS) scandal, they got into the health ministry and now they have brought Ifmis to continue stealing money through it,” he said amid cheers from his supporters. The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader further accused the government of swindling public funds saying “their time is now over”. His tour comes just a day after the Deputy President William Ruto concluded his four-day tour in the coast. Mr Ruto completed his tour with a public rally at the Tononoka Grounds where he declared that the party had made inroads in the region. His rally ran parallel with another one organised by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi where the two leaders dared the Jubilee administration to emulate Mr Kingi on his action of naming those involved in corruption scandal.
