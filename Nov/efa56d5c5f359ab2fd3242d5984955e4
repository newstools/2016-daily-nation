The Integrated Financial Management Information System (Ifmis), which was introduced by the government ostensibly to streamline financial transactions, has dominated media reports in recent times in light of the cases of massive corruption at the national and county governments. Governors have even blamed the system for the loss of funds and fraud in their counties. They argue that the system is inefficient and prone to hacking by fraudsters. This is a poorly disguised excuse for fraud. It is laughable to try to blame the loss of funds and accountability failures on a technical system. Ifmis is a globally accepted system that has served other countries well. Like any other information communication technology system, Ifmis is just as good as its user. When counties fail to account for millions of shillings in their vaults, someone must surely be responsible for it and must be held to account. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Treasury have pledged to audit Ifmis to identify its weaknesses and make recommendations on how to fix them. However, the system must not be used as the putative reason counties are losing money. There are devious characters who manipulate the system and they must be arrested, prosecuted, and punished if found guilty.
