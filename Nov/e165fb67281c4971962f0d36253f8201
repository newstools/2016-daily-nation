Maseno University has issued reporting dates after closure following student protests. First year students are required to report back on November 6, the rest are required back on November 7, which is when lectures will commence. However, there are requirements that students must meet before readmission. Some are: students will be required to show evidence of clearance of outstanding fees, payment of a Sh2,000 penalty and signing of a good conduct form. The institution was closed on November 1 after students went rioted over the murder of one of the colleagues. The student is said to have been killed by a villager at Mabungo, Maseno, in unclear circumstances. In retaliation, they went after the suspect lynching him and torching his house. They later took to the streets harassing motorists, barricading and lighting bonfires on the Kisumu/Busia road. Kisumu County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim confirmed the deaths and condemned the students' behaviour. "Students should not harass innocent motorists who are not involved in the incident. We are sending reinforcement from Kisumu to handle the situation," Mr Maalim said.
