Rajbir Rai stormed to his first victory in a Ford Fiesta R5 when he won the Kitengela Rally on Sunday. It was also the first time a Ford won a Kenya National Rally Championship leg in three decades. However, the victory was overshadowed by bitter rivals Jassi Chatthe and Tapio Laukkanen who lodged separate protests against each other on technical grounds. The issues were yet to be settled by the time of going to press. Rai, who is expected to retire from the sport after the season ending Guru Nanak Rally, had a flawless drive in his Fiesta. “We are happy to win the rally. We were lucky to have had no major problems,” said Rai. Tapio Laukkanen will have to wait longer before he is can lay his hands on the 2016 Kenya National Rally Drivers Champion title following the latest protest. The Finn wants to become the first foreigner to win the series. Though Laukkanen’s ambition was to win his fifth straight victory of the series, it turned out to be an eventful day after two separate punctures almost threw his championship ambitions out the window. Jassi Chatthe’s chances of retaining the title for the second year running were seriously dented after he suffered a puncture.   Natasha is among the 36 crews aiming for glory.
