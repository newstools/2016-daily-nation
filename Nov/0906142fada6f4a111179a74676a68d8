Ronald Melly, the 28-year-old who was arrested on Monday in Nairobi for practising medicine without qualifications, has been released on a Sh500,000 bond. Mr Melly on pleaded not guilty to the four charges levelled against him, among them forgery of documents, using the title doctor despite not being registered or licensed, and impersonation of a medical officer. Senior Principal Magistrate E. Juma said the case would be mentioned on December 13 and heard on March 13, next year. Mr Melly masqueraded as a University of Nairobi medicine graduate, a claim the institution denied stating he was never admitted as a student to the institution, and therefore was never trained at the institution. He was arrested at the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board offices by police from the Special Crimes Prevention Unit as he had gone to renew his permanent practising licence. This is a charge that he will answer to also. On the charge, court records read: “Attempting to fraudulently procure registration [after presenting himself as a duly qualified medical practitioner] contrary to section 19 of the Medical Practitioners and Dentist Act, CAP 253 Laws of Kenya”. Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya President Paul Mwaniki on Friday called for an audit of activities of various regulatory boards to identify gaps that led to the employment of Mr Melly.
