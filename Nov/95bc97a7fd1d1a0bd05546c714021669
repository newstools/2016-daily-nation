About Sh450 million has been recovered from the Sh1.8 billion lost in the National Youth Service scandal. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Chief Executive Halakhe Waqo said this figure, in the form of cash and assets, could rise as investigations continue. “This year, we recovered Sh700 million from different people implicated in corruption scandals,” he said. He said investigations into the Health ministry scandal would be concluded in two weeks and the files will soon be forwarded to Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko. “We have dealt with the matter expeditiously and we will have a report within the timeframe provided,” said Mr Waqo. Since April this year, the commission has concluded 21 cases of corruption, leading to 18 convictions, he added. The anti-graft agency boss called on Kenyans wishing to vie for elective posts in next year’s General Elections to prepare to declare their wealth. He also said this was now a requirement for every public and State officer and should be done every two years. Mr Waqo was speaking at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies at a workshop for commissions responsible for implementing Chapter Six of the Constitution, which deals with leadership and integrity. Speaking at the same occasion, Attorney-General Githu Muigai said Kenyans were clamouring for good governance, efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness in delivery of public services. “The government will be holding accounts officers of public entities personally liable for corruption in their entities. If you are a CEO and tolerate corruption in your institution, then you have no business being there,” he said.
