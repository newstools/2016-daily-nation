Former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Youth Affairs Seno Nyakenyanya has urged counties to invest heavily in youth. He said millions of youth across the counties are faced with serious social and economic challenges that should be urgently addressed. This, he said, would empower the youth in positively contributing to the development process of the nation. "It should not escape our attention that  youth can be a power for social evil  if they are neglected. The moment we fail  in this we would be sitting on a ticking time bomb," said the former PS. Mr Nyakenyanya who is eying the Kisii county's senatorial seat in the coming general election further called for the creation of  job opportunities  by the Counties to help youth help them flourish economically. "If their problems are ignored and swept under the carpet then we will be sabotaging the future of the nation," added Mr Nyakenyanya. He expressed concern that  many counties in the country are not allowing youth adequate space and time to unleash their potential. He advised that primary focus needs to be put into programs meant to realize their economic and social potential. And speaking at a fundraiser yesterday, South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya urged Kisii county leaders to prioritise on youth. He said many youth were arbitrarily locked out of jobs because of corruption and insufficient funding of their programs.
