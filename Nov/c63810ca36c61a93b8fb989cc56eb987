An MP has called for the consolidation of the Kieni dairy cooperatives to eliminate middlemen who are exploiting farmers. According to Kieni MP Kanini Kega, milk processing companies that buy milk have been offering low prices of Sh31 per litre, while the same quantity is being sold at a higher price. He was speaking during a stakeholders meeting at the Kieni Dairy Milking Plant on Friday. The MP said the meeting was held to discuss upgrading the plant to start processing mild. “We want to process our own milk into yoghurts, butter, cheese, milk powder so that we can increase our farmers’ earnings,” the MP said. Milk delivered to the plant is usually sold to milk processing plants such as Kenya Cooperative Creameries. “We are calling for milk processing companies to pay us at least Sh60 a litre of milk up from the current Sh31 they pay per litre,” said Mr Kega. Dairy farming is the livelihood for residents in Kieni. Kieni dairy collects up to 25, 000 litres of milk every day.
