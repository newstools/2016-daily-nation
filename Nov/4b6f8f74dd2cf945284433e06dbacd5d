A news anchor at a Kenyan television station has been arrested following an offensive by the Uganda People's Defence Force at the Obusinga Bwa Rwenzururu Palace in Kasese District on Sunday. Kenya Television Network (KTN) anchor Joy Doreen Biira was arrested in Kasese. She was said to be in Kasese for a traditional ceremony when the offensive was launched at the palace. Ms Biira was arrested alongside her fiancé and three other people from her uncle’s house. Uganda police spokesman Felix Kaweesi confirmed in an interview with KTN that Ms Biira was detained overnight. He said the journalist entered a restricted area during the operation by security personnel. He said the journalist “crossed the line” and that she will be granted bond Monday. Her arrest sparked social media outrage, with #FreeJoyDoreen trending Monday.   King Charles Wesley Mumbere holed up in his palace as heavy gunfire intensifies outside.
