Private Equity firm Leapfrog Investments has acquired a controlling stake at regional beauty and drugstore Goodlife Pharmacy. Leapfrog said Wednesday that it paid Sh2.2 billion to buy out the entire stake held by PE firm Catalyst Fund. Leapfrog’s move is indicative of the firm's growing interest in East Africa where it recently bought a majority stake in insurance provider Resolution Health.
